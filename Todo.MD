## 1. Data Collection & Preprocessing
- Gather high-quality Python code from diverse sources:
  - Open source repositories (GitHub, GitLab, etc)
  - Documentation and tutorials
  - Competitive programming solutions
  - Company internal codebases (if available)
- Clean and deduplicate code samples
- Normalize code formatting and style
- Generate synthetic data through:
  - Code mutation and transformation
  - Template-based generation
  - Program synthesis from natural language
  - Expert system generation of edge cases
  - Automated code completion chains

## 2. Training Data Enhancement
- Create instruction-code pairs through:
  - Mining commit messages and documentation
  - Automated code documentation generation
  - Natural language task descriptions
  - Test case to implementation mapping
  - Code review comments and suggestions
- Augment with:
  - Code execution traces
  - AST and control flow information  
  - Type hints and signatures
  - Code complexity metrics
  - Library/API usage patterns

## 3. Model Architecture
- Use transformer-based architecture optimized for code
- Implement:
  - Attention mechanisms for long code sequences
  - Tree-structured encoders for AST processing
  - Type-aware embeddings
  - Module/import aware contextual encoding
  - Multi-task learning heads for different code tasks

## 4. Training Process
- Multi-stage training:
  1. Supervised pretraining on code corpus
  2. Instruction tuning with human feedback
  3. Reinforcement learning from user interactions
  4. Fine-tuning on specific programming tasks
- Implement curriculum learning:
  - Start with simple programs
  - Gradually increase complexity
  - Introduce edge cases and error handling
  - Add advanced programming patterns

## 5. Reinforcement Learning Components
- Define reward functions for:
  - Code correctness (test case passing)
  - Code quality metrics
  - Efficiency and performance
  - Readability and maintainability
  - Security and best practices
- Create evaluation environments:
  - Automated code testing infrastructure
  - Performance benchmarking
  - Static analysis tools integration
  - Security scanning
  - Style checking

## 6. Evaluation & Benchmarking
- Test on standard code benchmarks:
  - HumanEval
  - MBPP
  - CodeContests
  - Project-specific test suites
- Evaluate:
  - Code generation quality
  - Code completion accuracy
  - Bug detection/fixing
  - Refactoring capabilities
  - Documentation generation

## 7. Safety & Alignment
- Implement safeguards:
  - Code security scanning
  - Vulnerability detection
  - License compliance checking
  - PII/sensitive data detection
- Add alignment techniques:
  - Value learning from human feedback
  - Code review alignment
  - Best practices enforcement
  - Style guide compliance

## 8. Deployment & Monitoring
- Set up:
  - Model serving infrastructure
  - Versioning and rollback capabilities
  - Performance monitoring
  - Usage analytics
  - Feedback collection
- Implement continuous learning:
  - User feedback incorporation
  - Online fine-tuning
  - Distribution shift detection
  - Quality monitoring

## 9. Research Areas
- Investigate:
  - Zero-shot code generation
  - Few-shot adaptation
  - Cross-language transfer
  - Code reasoning capabilities
  - Self-improvement mechanisms
  - Multi-modal code understanding
  - Interactive programming assistance

## 10. Tools & Infrastructure
