"Here's the problem you requested:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"title\": \"Easy: Fibonacci Sequence Generator\",\n    \"description\": \"The Fibonacci sequence is a series of numbers where each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, usually starting with 0 and 1. Write a function `fibonacci` that takes an integer n as input and returns the nth number in the Fibonacci sequence.\\n\\n#### Function Signature\\n```python\\ndef fibonacci(n: int) -> int:\\n```\\n\\n#### Input\\n- `n` (int): A positive integer representing the position of the Fibonacci sequence you want to retrieve.\\n\\n#### Output\\n- Returns the nth number in the Fibonacci sequence as an integer.\\n\\n#### Constraints\\n- 1 <= n <= 1000\\n\",\n    \"code\": \"def fibonacci(n: int) -> int:\\n    if n <= 0:\\n        return 0\\n    elif n == 1 or n == 2:\\n        return 1\\n    else:\\n        a, b = 1, 1\\n        for _ in range(2, n):\\n            a, b = b, a + b\\n        return b\\n\",\n    \"tests\": [\n        'assert fibonacci(1) == 1',\n        'assert fibonacci(2) == 1',\n        'assert fibonacci(3) == 2',\n        'assert fibonacci(4) == 3',\n        'assert fibonacci(5) == 5'\n    ]\n}\n```\n\nThis problem is considered easy as it involves generating a specific number in the Fibonacci sequence, which can be done using a simple loop. The provided code and test cases should cover all possible edge cases."
