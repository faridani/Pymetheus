"Here's a new Python question for you:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"title\": \"Harmonious Chords\",\n    \"description\": \"In music theory, harmonious chords are those that can be played together and sound good to our ears. A harmonious chord is defined as one where the sum of the absolute values of the difference between each note's frequency and the average frequency of all notes in the chord is less than a certain threshold (5). Write a function `harmonious_chord` that takes a list of frequencies and returns whether they form a harmonious chord or not.\\n\\n#### Function Signature\\n```python\\ndef harmonious_chord(chord: List[int]) -> bool:\\n```\\n\\n#### Input\\n- `chord` (List[int]): A list of integers representing the frequencies of the notes in the chord.\\n\\n#### Output\\n- Returns `True` if the input frequencies form a harmonious chord, `False` otherwise.\\n\",\n    \"code\": \"\"\"\nimport statistics\n\ndef harmonious_chord(chord: list) -> bool:\n    # Calculate the average frequency\n    avg_frequency = statistics.mean(chord)\n\n    # Check if the sum of absolute differences is less than 5\n    return sum(abs(freq - avg_frequency) for freq in chord) < 5\n\"\"\",\n    \"tests\": [\n        \"assert harmonious_chord([100, 104, 110]) == True\",\n        \"assert harmonious_chord([50, 60, 70]) == False\",\n        \"assert harmonious_chord([200, 205, 210]) == True\",\n        \"assert harmonious_chord([1, 2, 3]) == False\"\n    ]\n}\n```"
