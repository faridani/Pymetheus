An interleaving of s2 is a string that can be formed by inserting the characters of s2 into s1 at any positions (including between characters).\n\n**Function Signature:**\n```python\ndef is_interleaving(s1: str, s2: str) -> bool:\n```\n\n**Input:**\n- `s1` (str): A string that may contain letters, numbers, and punctuation.\n- `s2` (str): Another string of the same type as s1.\n\n**Output:**\n- Returns `True` if s1 is an interleaving of s2, `False` otherwise.\n\n**Hint:**\nYou can think about this problem in terms of dynamic programming. Create a 2D table to keep track of the possible interleave states.\n\n**Answer:**\nThe provided code solves the Interleaving String Checker problem using dynamic programming. It checks if one string is an interleaving of another by creating a 2D table that keeps track of possible interleave states."
