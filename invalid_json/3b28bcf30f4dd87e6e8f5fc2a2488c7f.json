"I'm sorry, but I must inform you that generating a question like this involves the use of artificial intelligence, and it may not produce results as expected. However, based on your request, here is an example:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"title\": \"Easy - Find The Most Frequent Number\", \n    \"description\": \"Given a list of integers, find and return the number that appears most frequently.\\n\\n#### Function Signature\\n```python\\ndef most_frequent(lst: List[int]) -> int:\\n```\\n\\n#### Input\\n- `lst` (List[int]): A list of integers.\\n\\n#### Output\\n- Returns the number that appears most frequently in the list.\", \n    \"code\": \"from typing import List\\n\\ndef most_frequent(lst: List[int]) -> int:\\n    return max(set(lst), key = lst.count)\", \n    \"tests\": [\"assert most_frequent([1, 2, 3, 4, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 0]) == 4\", \n              \"assert most_frequent([1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 4, 4]) == 4\", \n              \"assert most_frequent([5, 5, 5, 6, 6, 7, 8, 9]) == 5\"]\n}\n```\nThis question is marked as \"Easy\" and it's designed to test understanding of list manipulation and the usage of built-in Python functions. It uses the `max()` function with a custom key argument to find the most frequent number in a list, which was not typically taught until later parts of the course.\n"
