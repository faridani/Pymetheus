"Here's a new Python coding question for you:\n\n{\"title\": \"Easy: Guess the Number\", \n\"description\": \"Write a function `guess_the_number` that takes two inputs, `target` and `guesses`. The function should return the number of attempts it took to guess the target number.\\n\\n#### Function Signature\\n```python\\ndef guess_the_number(target: int, guesses: list[int]) -> int:\\n```\\n\\n#### Input\\n- `target` (int): A random integer between 1 and 100.\\n- `guesses` (list[int]): A list of integers representing the attempts made to guess the target number.\\n\\n#### Output\\n- Returns the index of the first guess that equals the target number.
