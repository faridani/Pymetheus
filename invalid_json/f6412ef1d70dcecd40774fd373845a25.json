"{\n\"title\": \"Greatest Common Divisor of a List\",\n\"description\": \"Find the greatest common divisor (GCD) for each pair of numbers provided in an array. The function should handle both positive and negative integers, as well as zero. The GCD is defined as the largest positive integer that divides each of the integers without leaving a remainder. Write a function `find_gcd_of_list` to solve this problem.\\n\\n#### Function Signature\\n```python\\ndef find_gcd_of_list(nums: list) -> list:\\n```\\n\\n#### Input\\n- `nums` (list): A list of integers, which may include positive and negative numbers as well as zero.\\n\\n#### Output\\n- Returns a list of the greatest common divisor for each consecutive pair in the input list.
