"\nTitle: The Mysterious Codewords\n\nDescription: You are given a list of codewords, each consisting of letters and numbers. Your task is to write a function that takes a codeword as input and returns the corresponding mystery word. The mystery word is also a codeword, but it may contain different letters and numbers than the input codeword.\n\nFunction Signature: `def solve_mystery(code: str) -> str:`\n\nInput: A string in the format of a codeword (letters and numbers).\n\nOutput: The corresponding mystery word as a string.\n\nConstraints:\n\n* The input codeword may contain any combination of letters and numbers, but it must be a valid codeword.\n* The output mystery word must also be a valid codeword.\n* There are no additional constraints on the length or format of the input or output strings.\n\nHints:\n\n* Think about how you can represent each letter and number in the input codeword as a binary sequence (0s and 1s).\n* Consider using bitwise operations to manipulate these binary sequences.\n* The mystery word may be longer or shorter than the input codeword, but it must contain the same letters and numbers.\n\nTests:\n\n* assert solve_mystery(\"A man, a plan, a canal, Panama\") == \"Nixon\"\n* assert solve_mystery(\"racecar\") == \"cracr\"\n* assert solve_mystery(\"hello\") == \"lohel\"\n* assert solve_mystery(\"No \\'x\\' in Nixon\") == \"Xixon\"\n\nNote: This problem is medium difficulty. It requires some creative thinking and a good understanding of binary representation and bitwise operations."
