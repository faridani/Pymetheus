"Here is a new Python coding question for you:\n\n{\"title\": \"Easy: Student Grade Calculator\", \n\"description\": \"Write a function `calculate_grade` that calculates the final grade of a student based on their scores. The function should take three arguments: `midterm_score`, `final_score`, and `homework_score`. The grades are calculated as follows:\\n\\n#### Function Signature\\n```python\\ndef calculate_grade(midterm_score: int, final_score: int, homework_score: int) -> str:\\n```\\n\\n#### Input\\n- `midterm_score` (int): The score for the midterm exam.\\n- `final_score` (int): The score for the final exam.\\n- `homework_score` (int): The total score for all homework assignments.\\n\\n#### Output\\n- Returns a string representing the student's grade, such as 'A', 'B', 'C', etc., based on their total score.\", \n\"code\": \"def calculate_grade(midterm_score: int, final_score: int, homework_score: int) -> str:\\n    total_score = (midterm_score + final_score + homework_score) / 3\\n    if total_score >= 90:\\n        return 'A'\\n    elif total_score >= 80:\\n        return 'B'\\n    elif total_score >= 70:\\n        return 'C'\\n    elif total_score >= 60:\\n        return 'D'\\n    else:\\n        return 'F'\", \n\"tests\": [\"assert calculate_grade(85, 90, 75) == 'A'\", \"assert calculate_grade(70, 80, 65) == 'B'\", \"assert calculate_grade(50, 60, 40) == 'D'\", \"assert calculate_grade(20, 30, 10) == 'F'\"]}"
