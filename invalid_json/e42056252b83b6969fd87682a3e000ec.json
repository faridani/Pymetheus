"Here is your requested medium Python coding question:\n\n{\n\"title\": \"Sudoku Solver (Medium)\",\n\"description\": \"A Sudoku puzzle is a 9x9 grid, divided into nine 3x3 sub-grids or 'regions.' Some numbers are filled in to make the puzzle more difficult. Write a function `solve_sudoku` that takes a partially filled-in Sudoku puzzle as input and returns the solution if it exists. If no solution exists, return an empty list.\\n\\n#### Function Signature\\n```python\\ndef solve_sudoku(board: list) -> list:\\n```\\n\\n#### Input\\n- `board` (list): A 2D list representing a Sudoku board, where each element is either an integer from 1 to 9 or 0. The number of rows and columns in the grid should be equal.\\n\\n#### Output\\n- Returns the solution to the Sudoku puzzle as a 2D list if it exists, otherwise returns an empty list.\\n\", \n\"code\": \"\"\"\nimport copy\n\ndef solve_sudoku(board: list) -> list:\n    for i in range(len(board)):\n        for j in range(len(board[i])):\n            if board[i][j] == 0:\n                for num in range(1, 10):\n                    if is_valid(board, i, j, num):\n                        board[i][j] = num\n                        result = solve_sudoku(board)\n                        if result:\n                            return result\n                        else:\n                            board[i][j] = 0\n                return []\n    return board\n\ndef is_valid(board: list, row: int, col: int, num: int) -> bool:\n    # Check the row\n    for i in range(len(board)):\n        if board[row][i] == num:\n            return False\n    \n    # Check the column\n    for i in range(len(board)):\n        if board[i][col] == num:\n            return False\n\n    start_row = (row // 3) * 3\n    start_col = (col // 3) * 3\n    for i in range(3):\n        for j in range(3):\n            if board[start_row + i][start_col + j] == num:\n                return False\n    \n    return True\n\n# Test cases\nassert solve_sudoku([[5,1,7,6,0,0,0,3,4],\n                     [2,8,9,0,0,4,0,0,0],\n                     [3,4,6,7,8,5,0,9,1],\n                     [0,6,3,5,2,0,8,1,4],\n                     [1,0,4,3,0,0,2,5,6],\n                     [8,5,0,0,0,3,4,6,7],\n                     [4,2,6,1,9,5,3,0,8],\n                     [3,1,0,4,5,2,0,6,0],\n                     [6,3,2,8,5,1,4,7,9]]) == [[5,1,7,6,9,8,4,3,4],\n                     [2,8,9,5,3,4,6,1,7],\n                     [3,4,6,7,8,5,2,9,1],\n                     [9,6,3,5,2,1,8,4,7],\n                     [1,4,4,3,5,7,2,5,6],\n                     [8,5,9,1,4,3,4,6,7],\n                     [4,2,6,1,9,5,3,8,8],\n                     [3,1,8,4,5,2,6,7,9],\n                     [6,3,2,8,5,1,4,7,9]]\nassert solve_sudoku([[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]]) == []\nassert solve_sudoku([[1,2,3],[4,5,6],[7,8,9]]) == [[1,2,3],[4,5,6],[7,8,9]]\nassert solve_sudoku([[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],\n                     [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],\n                     [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]]) == []\nassert solve_sudoku([[1,2],[3,4]]) == [[1,2],[3,4]]\n\"\"\", \n\"tests\": [\"assert is_valid([[5,1,7,6,0,0,0,3,4], [2,8,9,0,0,4,0,0,0], [3,4,6,7,8,5,0,9,1], [0,6,3,5,2,0,8,1,4], [1,0,4,3,0,0,2,5,6], [8,5,0,0,0,3,4,6,7], [4,2,6,1,9,5,3,0,8], [3,1,0,4,5,2,0,6,0], [6,3,2,8,5,1,4,7,9]]) == True\", \n\"assert is_valid([[1,2],[3,4]]) == True\", \"assert is_valid([[0,0],[1,0]]) == False\", \"assert solve_sudoku([[5,1,7,6,0,0,0,3,4], [2,8,9,0,0,4,0,0,0], [3,4,6,7,8,5,0,9,1], [0,6,3,5,2,0,8,1,4], [1,0,4,3,0,0,2,5,6], [8,5,0,0,0,3,4,6,7], [4,2,6,1,9,5,3,0,8], [3,1,0,4,5,2,0,6,0], [6,3,2,8,5,1,4,7,9]]) == [[5,1,7,6,9,8,4,3,4], [2,8,9,5,3,4,6,1,7], [3,4,6,7,8,5,2,9,1], [9,6,3,5,2,1,8,4,7], [1,4,4,3,5,7,2,5,6], [8,5,9,1,4,3,4,6,7], [4,2,6,1,9,5,3,8,8], [3,1,8,4,5,2,6,7,9], [6,3,2,8,5,1,4,7,9]]\"]"
