"Here is a medium-level Python coding problem for you, presented in the format that you specified:\n```json\n{\n    \"title\": \"Number Flip Game\",\n    \"description\": \"You are given a positive integer `num` and two integers `a` and `b`. The game consists of repeatedly performing the following operation: take the current number, flip it (i.e., if it's an even number, subtract 2; if it's an odd number, add 2). You can perform this operation any number of times. Given this information, determine if you can obtain a value greater than or equal to `a` and less than or equal to `b` after some number of operations. Return True if possible, False otherwise.\\n\\n#### Function Signature\\n```python\\ndef number_flip_game(num: int, a: int, b: int) -> bool:\\n```\\n\\n#### Input\\n- `num` (int): The starting positive integer.\\n- `a` (int): The lower bound for the target range.\\n- `b` (int): The upper bound for the target range.\\n\\n#### Output\\n- Returns `True` if it's possible to obtain a number in the range `[a, b]` with repeated operations, `False` otherwise.\\n\",\n    \"code\": \"def number_flip_game(num: int, a: int, b: int) -> bool:\\n    # Check base case: if num is within the target range\\n    if a <= num <= b:\\n        return True\\n\\n    # Check for even numbers\\n    if num % 2 == 0:\\n        # Flip the even number by subtracting 2\\n        num -= 2\\n        # Recursively check if the new number is within the target range\\n        return number_flip_game(num, a, b)\\n\\n    # Check for odd numbers\\n    else:\\n        # Flip the odd number by adding 2\\n        num += 2\\n        # Recursively check if the new number is within the target range\\n        return number_flip_game(num, a, b)\\n\",\n    \"tests\": [\n        \"assert number_flip_game(1, 0, 10) == True\",\n        \"assert number_flip_game(5, 2, 8) == True\",\n        \"assert number_flip_game(3, 6, 9) == False\",\n        \"assert number_flip_game(2, 1, 3) == True\"\n    ]\n}\n```"
