"Here is the Python coding question:\n\n{\"title\": \"Easy: Fizz Buzz\", \n\"description\": \"The Fizz Buzz problem is a classic example of a programming problem. It requires the program to generate a sequence of numbers where each number that is divisible by 3 should be replaced with 'Fizz', each number that is divisible by 5 should be replaced with 'Buzz', and each number that is divisible by both 3 and 5 should be replaced with 'FizzBuzz'. For the remaining numbers, the program should print the number itself.\\n\\n#### Function Signature\\n```python\\ndef fizz_buzz(n: int) -> None:\\n```\\n\\n#### Input\\n- `n` (int): The input integer up to which we want to generate the Fizz Buzz sequence.\\n\\n#### Output\\n- Prints a Fizz Buzz sequence for numbers from 1 to `n`.\\n\", \n\"code\": \"def fizz_buzz(n: int) -> None:\\n    for i in range(1, n+1):\\n        if i % 3 == 0 and i % 5 == 0:\\n            print('FizzBuzz')\\n        elif i % 3 == 0:\\n            print('Fizz')\\n        elif i % 5 == 0:\\n            print('Buzz')\\n        else:\\n            print(i)\\n\", \n\"tests\": [\"assert '1\\n2\\Fizz\\n4\\nFoo5\\nFizz7\\n8\\nFizzBuzz9\\n10\\nFizz\\n12\\nFizzBuzz13\\n14\\nFizz16\\nBuzz17\\n19\\nFizzBuzz20' == ''.join(fizz_buzz(i) for i in range(1, 21))\", \"assert '1\\n2\\Fizz4\\nFoo6\\n7\\n8\\n9\\n' == ''.join(fizz_buzz(i) for i in range(1, 10))\"]}"
