"Here is an insanely difficult Python coding question for you:\n\n```\n{\n    \"title\": \"Finding the Shortest Path to a Mysterious Island\",\n    \"description\": \"You are given a grid of size `n x n` where each cell contains either a landmass or water. You start at the top-left corner of the grid and want to reach the mysterious island (which is located in one of the cells) by moving either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally through the landmasses. The distance between two adjacent cells is always 1 unit. Write a function `shortest_path` that returns the shortest possible path length from the top-left corner to the mysterious island.\\n\\n#### Function Signature\\n```python\\ndef shortest_path(grid: list[list[bool]], n: int, island_location: tuple[int, int]) -> int:\\n```\\n\\n#### Input\\n- `grid` (list of lists): A 2D grid where each cell contains either a landmass (`True`) or water (`False`). The mysterious island is located at the coordinates `(island_location[0], island_location[1])`.\n- `n` (int): The size of the grid.\n- `island_location` (tuple): The coordinates of the mysterious island in the grid.\n\n#### Output\\n- Returns the shortest possible path length from the top-left corner to the mysterious island.\\n\",\n    \"code\": \"\"\"\nfrom collections import deque\n\ndef shortest_path(grid, n, island_location):\n    queue = deque([(0, 0, 0)])  # Initialize the queue with the starting point and distance\n    visited = set((0, 0))  # Set to keep track of visited cells\n    \n    while queue:\n        x, y, dist = queue.popleft()\n        \n        if (x, y) == island_location:  # If we've reached the mysterious island\n            return dist\n        \n        for dx, dy in [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1), (-1, -1), (-1, 1), (1, -1), (1, 1)]:  # Explore all adjacent cells\n            nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy\n            \n            if (nx >= 0 and nx < n and ny >= 0 and ny < n and  # Check if the cell is within the grid boundaries\n                    not visited.contains((nx, ny)) and \n                    grid[nx][ny]):  # Check if the cell contains a landmass\n                queue.append((nx, ny, dist + 1))  # Add the cell to the queue with the updated distance\n                visited.add((nx, ny))  # Mark the cell as visited\n    \n    return -1  # If we've reached this point, it means there's no path to the mysterious island\n\"\"\",\n    \"tests\": [\n        \"assert shortest_path([['X', 'X', 'X'], ['X', 'O', 'X'], ['X', 'X', 'X']], 3, (1, 1)) == 2\",\n        \"assert shortest_path([['X', 'X', 'X', 'X'], ['O', 'O', 'O', 'X'], ['X', 'X', 'X', 'X'], ['X', 'O', 'O', 'X']], 4, (3, 1)) == 6\",\n        \"assert shortest_path([['X', 'X', 'X'], ['X', 'O', 'X'], ['X', 'X', 'X']], 3, (0, 2)) == -1\"\n    ]\n}\n```\n\nGood luck!"
