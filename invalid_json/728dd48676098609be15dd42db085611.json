"Here is your requested Python coding question:\n\n{\n\"title\": \"Hard: Word Chain Generator\",\n\"description\": \"A word chain, also known as a word association or word link, is a sequence of words where each word starts with the last letter of the previous word. Write a function `word_chain` that generates a list of words starting from a given initial word and stopping when it reaches a predetermined length.\\n\\n#### Function Signature\\n```python\\ndef word_chain(initial_word: str, length: int) -> list[str]:\\n```\\n\\n#### Input\\n- `initial_word` (str): The first word in the chain.\\n- `length` (int): The desired length of the generated chain.\\n\\n#### Output\\n- Returns a list of words as described above.\\n\",\n\"code\": \"\"\"\nimport enchant\ndef word_chain(initial_word: str, length: int) -> list[str]:\n    # Create an English dictionary to check for valid words\n    d = enchant.Dict(\"en_US\")\n    \n    # Initialize the result chain with the initial word\n    result = [initial_word]\n    \n    # Generate the rest of the chain\n    current_word = initial_word[-1]  # Get the last letter of the initial word\n    while len(result) < length:\n        words = d.suggest(current_word)\n        if not words:  # If no valid words are found, stop generating the chain\n            break\n        \n        next_word = random.choice(words)\n        result.append(next_word)\n        current_word = next_word[-1]  # Get the last letter of the new word\n    \n    return result\n\"\"\",\n\"tests\": [\n\"assert len(word_chain('apple', 3)) == 3\",\n\"assert all(word_chain('word', 5)[1:] == ['rood', 'doom', 'mood'])\",\n\"assert not word_chain('long', 4)\"\n]\n}\n\nNote: The enchant library is required for this problem, you can install it using pip:\n\n`pip install pyenchant`\n\nAlso, the random module is used in the code to select a random word from the dictionary's suggestions."
