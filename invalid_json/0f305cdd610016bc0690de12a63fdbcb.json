"Here's the medium Python coding question for you:\n\n```\n{\n    \"title\": \"Sudoku Validator\",\n    \"description\": \"Sudoku is a popular puzzle game where a 9x9 grid of numbers must be filled out according to certain rules. The goal is to fill in all the empty cells so that each row, column, and 3x3 sub-grid contains the numbers 1-9 without repeating any number.\\n\\nWrite a function `validate_sudoku` that takes as input a 2D list representing the Sudoku board, where empty cells are represented by zeros. The function should return True if the Sudoku board is valid according to the rules of the game, and False otherwise.\\n\\n#### Function Signature\\n```python\\ndef validate_sudoku(board: list) -> bool:\\n```\\n\\n#### Input\\n- `board` (list): A 2D list representing the Sudoku board.
