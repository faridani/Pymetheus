    "description": "You are given a list of transactions, where each transaction is represented as a tuple of two integers, `buy` and `sell`. The profit from a transaction is calculated as `(sell - buy)`, assuming the sell price is after the buy price. Your task is to write a function that calculates the maximum possible total profit.\n\n#### Function Signature\n```python\ndef max_profit(transactions: list[tuple[int, int]]) -> int:\n```\n\n#### Input\n- `transactions` (list[tuple[int, int]]): A list of transactions, where each transaction is represented as a tuple of two integers, `buy` and `sell`.\n\n#### Output\n- Returns the maximum possible total profit.",
