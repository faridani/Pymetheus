    "description": "You are given a list of tasks with their respective times and deadlines. Write a function that calculates the minimum time required to finish all tasks before their deadlines.\n\n#### Function Signature\n```python\ndef min_time_required(tasks: list) -> int:\n```\n\n#### Input\n- `tasks` (list): A list of tasks where each task is represented as a tuple `(time, deadline)` and `time` and `deadline` are integers. The time represents the amount of time required to finish the task and the deadline represents the maximum allowed time to finish the task.\n\n#### Output\n- Returns the minimum time required to finish all tasks before their deadlines.",
