    "description": "In a regular triangle, the perimeter of two sides is equal to the third side. Write a function `count_triangles` that takes an integer `n` as input and returns the number of triangles with perimeters less than or equal to `n`. The function should consider only integers for the lengths of the sides.\n\n#### Function Signature\n```python\ndef count_triangles(n: int) -> int:\n```\n\n#### Input\n- `n` (int): An integer representing the maximum perimeter of a triangle.\n\n#### Output\n- Returns an integer representing the number of triangles with perimeters less than or equal to `n`.",
