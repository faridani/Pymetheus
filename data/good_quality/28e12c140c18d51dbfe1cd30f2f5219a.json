    "description": "The description of the problem.\n\nA Sudoku puzzle is a 9x9 grid that can be divided into nine 3x3 sub-grids or 'regions.' Some numbers are filled in, while others are blank. The goal is to fill in all the blank cells with numbers from 1 to 9 such that each row, column, and region contains each number exactly once.\n\nWrite a function `validate_sudoku` that takes as input a list of lists representing a Sudoku puzzle. Each sublist represents a row of the grid, and each element of the sublist is either an integer between 1 and 9 (inclusive) or None to represent a blank cell.\n\n#### Function Signature\n```python\ndef validate_sudoku(board: list[list[int|None]]) -> bool:\n```\n\n#### Input\n- `board` (list[list[int|None]]): A Sudoku puzzle represented as a 9x9 grid, where each element is either an integer between 1 and 9 (inclusive) or None.\n\n#### Output\n- Returns `True` if the input Sudoku puzzle is valid, `False` otherwise.",
