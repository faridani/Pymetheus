    "description": "A farmer has N flowers planted in a row, and each flower takes K days to bloom. The farmer can water any number of flowers at once. However, for every M consecutive flowers that he waters, the time it takes for them all to bloom increases by 1 day. Write a function `min_time` that calculates the minimum time required to make all the flowers bloom.\n\n#### Function Signature\n```python\ndef min_time(N: int, K: int, M: int) -> int:\n```\n\n#### Input\n- `N` (int): The number of flowers planted in a row.\n- `K` (int): The number of days it takes for each flower to bloom.\n- `M` (int): The maximum consecutive flowers that can be watered at once.\n\n#### Output\n- Returns the minimum time required to make all the flowers bloom.",
