    "description": "Write a function that calculates the sum of squares of all integers from 1 to `n`, where `n` is an integer input. The function should return this sum.\n\n#### Function Signature\n```python\ndef sum_of_squares(n: int) -> int:\n```\n\n#### Input\n- `n` (int): An integer that represents the upper limit for the sum of squares.\n\n#### Output\n- Returns the sum of squares of all integers from 1 to `n`.",
