    "description": "The egg drop puzzle is a classic problem where you are given n eggs and a building with k floors. The goal is to find the highest floor that you can check without breaking any of the eggs. You can place an egg on a floor, but then it will be broken if the egg is dropped from a higher floor. If the egg survives, you know the floor above that one is safe.\n\n#### Function Signature\n```python\ndef max_egg_floor(n: int, k: int) -> int:\n```\n\n#### Input\n- `n` (int): The number of eggs available.\n- `k` (int): The number of floors in the building.\n\n#### Output\n- Returns the highest floor that you can check without breaking any of the eggs.",
