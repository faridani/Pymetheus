A triangle can be formed if the sum of the lengths of any two sides is greater than the length of the third side.\n\n#### Function Signature\n```python\ndef count_triangles(triangles: list[int]) -> int:\n```\n\n#### Input\n- `triangles` (list[int]): A list of integers representing the lengths of the sides of triangles.\n\n#### Output\n- Returns the number of possible triangles that can be formed from the given list.",
