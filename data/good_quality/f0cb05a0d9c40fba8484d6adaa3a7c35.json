    "description": "A positive integer n is said to be a perfect number if it has exactly one proper divisor (other than 1). Write a function `perfect_sum` that calculates the sum of divisors for a given number.\n\n#### Function Signature\n```python\ndef perfect_sum(n: int) -> int:\n```\n\n#### Input\n- `n` (int): A positive integer.\n\n#### Output\n- Returns the sum of all divisors of the input number, including 1 and the number itself.",
