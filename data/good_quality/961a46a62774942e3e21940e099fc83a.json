    "description": "Write a function `fizz_buzz` that prints out the numbers from 1 to n, where n is given as an input. If the number is divisible by 3, it should print 'Fizz'. If the number is divisible by 5, it should print 'Buzz'. If the number is divisible by both 3 and 5, it should print 'FizzBuzz'. Otherwise, it should just print the number.\n\n#### Function Signature\n```python\ndef fizz_buzz(n: int) -> None:\n```\n\n#### Input\n- `n` (int): The highest number up to which you need to print out FizzBuzz sequence.\n\n#### Output\n- Prints out the FizzBuzz sequence.",
