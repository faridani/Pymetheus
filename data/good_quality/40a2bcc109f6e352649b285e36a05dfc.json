    "description": "The math problem: You have a set of 5 unique books, including one novel by Hemingway, one mystery novel by Agatha Christie, and three romance novels. If you were to randomly select 3 out of the 5 books, what is the probability that none of them are romance novels? Assume that each book has an equal chance of being selected.\n\n#### Function Signature\n```python\ndef find_probability() -> float:\n```\n\n#### Input\n- None\n\n#### Output\n- Returns a floating point number representing the probability that none of the 3 randomly selected books are romance novels.",
