The farmer wants to count how many eggs are left in the basket before the first egg hatches. Write a function `count_untouched_eggs` that takes as input the numbers written on the eggs and returns the total number of untouched eggs.\n\n#### Function Signature\n```python\ndef count_untouched_eggs(eggs: list[int]) -> int:\n```\n\n#### Input\n- `eggs` (list[int]): A list of integers representing the day when each egg will hatch.\n\n#### Output\n- Returns the total number of untouched eggs.",
