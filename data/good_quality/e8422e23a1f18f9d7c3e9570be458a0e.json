    "description": "A farmer's market has a special requirement for the eggs to be packed in cartons. The cartons are rectangular with dimensions 6 inches long, 4 inches wide and 1 inch high. Write a function `fill_carton` that calculates the maximum number of eggs that can fit into the carton.\n\n#### Function Signature\n```python\ndef fill_carton() -> int:\n```\n\n#### Input\nNone.\n\n#### Output\n- Returns an integer representing the maximum number of eggs that can fit into the carton.",
