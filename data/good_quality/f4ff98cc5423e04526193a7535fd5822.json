Write a function that returns the number of islands in the given grid.\n\n#### Function Signature\n```python\ndef count_islands(grid: list) -> int:\n```\n\n#### Input\n- `grid` (list): A 2D list of size M x N, where each cell contains either 0 or 1.\n\n#### Output\n- Returns the number of islands in the given grid.",
