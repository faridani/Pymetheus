    "description": "Euler's spiral, also known as the arclength spiral or the logarithmic spiral, is a mathematical concept used to describe the growth of certain organisms. It is defined by the equation `r = a * exp(b*t)`, where `r` is the radial distance from the origin, `a` and `b` are constants, and `t` is time.\n\nWrite a function `euler_spiral_nth_point` that takes two parameters: `N` (the Nth point to find) and `params` (a tuple of `(a, b)`), and returns the coordinates (`x`, `y`) of the Nth point on Euler's spiral.\n\n#### Function Signature\n```python\ndef euler_spiral_nth_point(N: int, params: tuple) -> tuple:\n```\n\n#### Input\n- `N` (int): The Nth point to find on Euler's spiral.\n- `params` (tuple): A tuple of `(a, b)` coefficients for Euler's spiral equation.\n\n#### Output\n- Returns a tuple (`x`, `y`) representing the coordinates of the Nth point on Euler's spiral.",
