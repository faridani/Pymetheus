    "description": "The Catalan numbers are a sequence of natural numbers that occur in various counting problems, such as the number of ways to triangulate an n-gon. They are named after the mathematician Eug\u00e8ne Charles Catalan.\n\nWrite a function `catalan_number` that calculates the nth Catalan number.\n\n#### Function Signature\n```\ndef catalan_number(n: int) -> int:\n```\n\n#### Input\n- `n` (int): A non-negative integer representing the position in the sequence of Catalan numbers.\n\n#### Output\n- Returns the nth Catalan number as an integer.\n\nNote: You can use any mathematical formula or method to calculate the Catalan number. However, you must prove that your function is correct by testing it for a few values of n.",
