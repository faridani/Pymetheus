The function should return the minimum possible area.\n\n#### Function Signature\n```python\ndef min_area(rectangles: list[tuple[int, int, int, int]]) -> int:\n```\n\n#### Input\n- `rectangles` (list[tuple[int, int, int, int]]): A list of rectangles where each rectangle is represented as a tuple of four integers `(x1, y1), (x2, y1), (x1, y2), and (x2, y2)`.\n\n#### Output\n- Returns the minimum possible area that can be covered by at most one rectangle.",
