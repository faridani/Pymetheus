    "description": "A triangle is a polygon with three sides. A right-angled triangle is a triangle whose one angle is 90 degrees (a quarter turn). Write a function that calculates the sum of the squares of the lengths of the sides of a right-angled triangle.\n\n#### Function Signature\n```\ndef sum_of_squares(a: int, b: int, c: int) -> int:\n```",
