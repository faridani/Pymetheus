    "description": "Write a function `unscramble` that takes two strings as input. The first string represents a scrambled set of letters, and the second string represents a word from a dictionary. The function should return True if it's possible to unscramble the scrambled letters into the given word, and False otherwise.\n\n#### Function Signature\n```python\ndef unscramble(scrambled: str, target: str) -> bool:\n```\n\n#### Input\n- `scrambled` (str): A string that contains a set of scrambled letters.\n- `target` (str): A string representing the word from a dictionary.\n\n#### Output\n- Returns `True` if it's possible to unscramble the scrambled letters into the given word, and `False` otherwise.",
