    "description": "Write a function `divisible_numbers` that takes two integers, `a` and `b`, as input. The function should return all numbers from `1` to `n` (inclusive) that are divisible by both `a` and `b`. Here, `n` is the maximum number up to which we need to check divisibility.\n\n#### Function Signature\n```python\ndef divisible_numbers(a: int, b: int, n: int) -> list[int]:\n```\n\n#### Input\n- `a` (int): The first divisor.\n- `b` (int): The second divisor.\n- `n` (int): The maximum number up to which we need to check divisibility.\n\n#### Output\n- A list of integers that are divisible by both `a` and `b`, from `1` to `n` (inclusive).",
