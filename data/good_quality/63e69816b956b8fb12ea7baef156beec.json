    "description": "Write a function that counts the total number of coins, given a list of coin denominations and their respective quantities. The function should take two lists as input: one for coin denominations and one for their quantities.\n\n#### Function Signature\n```python\ndef count_coins(denominations: list[int], quantities: list[int]) -> int:\n```\n\n#### Input\n- `denominations` (list[int]): A list of coin denominations, where each denomination is an integer.\n- `quantities` (list[int]): A list of quantities corresponding to the coin denominations.\n\n#### Output\n- Returns the total number of coins.",
