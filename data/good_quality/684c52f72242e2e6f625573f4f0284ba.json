    "description": "Write a function `is_perfect_square` that checks if a given integer is a perfect square. A perfect square is an integer that can be expressed as the square of an integer, for example, 16 is a perfect square because it can be expressed as 4^2.\n\n#### Function Signature\n```python\ndef is_perfect_square(n: int) -> bool:\n```\n\n#### Input\n- `n` (int): An integer that may be positive or negative.\n\n#### Output\n- Returns `True` if the input integer is a perfect square, `False` otherwise.",
    "code": "def is_perfect_square(n: int) -> bool:\n    sqrt = n ** 0.5\n    return sqrt == int(sqrt)",
