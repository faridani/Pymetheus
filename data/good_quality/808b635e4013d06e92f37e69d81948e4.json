    "description": "Write a function `solve_sudoku` that solves a Sudoku puzzle. The function takes as input a 2D list of integers, where each integer represents the number in the corresponding cell of the Sudoku grid (0 means the cell is empty). The function should return a 2D list representing the solved Sudoku puzzle.\n\nThe function can use any algorithm or data structure it likes to solve the puzzle. However, note that the Sudoku puzzle may not always have a unique solution, and the function should return one possible solution if multiple solutions exist.\n\n#### Function Signature\n```python\ndef solve_sudoku(board: list) -> list:\n```\n\n#### Input\n- `board` (list): A 2D list of integers representing the Sudoku grid. The size of the grid is assumed to be 9x9, with rows and columns labeled from 0 to 8.\n\n#### Output\n- Returns a 2D list representing the solved Sudoku puzzle.",
