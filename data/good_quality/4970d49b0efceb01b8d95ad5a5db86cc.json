    "description": "Write a function `fizz_buzz` that takes an integer `n` as input and returns a string that represents the FizzBuzz sequence up to `n`. The FizzBuzz sequence is a series of numbers starting from 1, where each number is replaced by a word: 1 is 'one', 2 is 'two', ... , 4 is 'four', 5 is 'fizz', 7 is 'buzz', and for multiples of both 3 and 5, the string should be 'fizz buzz'.\n\n#### Function Signature\n```python\ndef fizz_buzz(n: int) -> str:\n```\n\n#### Input\n- `n` (int): An integer that represents the length of the FizzBuzz sequence.\n\n#### Output\n- Returns a string that represents the FizzBuzz sequence up to `n`. For example, if you input 15, it should return 'one two three four fizz five six seven fizz buzz eight nine ten eleven twelve thirteen fourteen fizz buzz'.",
