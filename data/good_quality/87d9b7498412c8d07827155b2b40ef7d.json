    "description": "The Tower of Hanoi is a mathematical puzzle where we have three rods and n disks. The objective of the game is to move the entire stack to another rod, obeying the following simple rules:\n- Only one disk can be moved at a time.\n- Each move consists of taking the upper disk from one of the stacks and placing it on top of another stack or on an empty rod.\n- No disk may be placed on top of a smaller disk.\n\nWrite a function `tower_of_hanoi` that takes as input the number of disks `n`, and returns the minimum number of moves required to solve the Tower of Hanoi puzzle.\n\n#### Function Signature\n```python\ndef tower_of_hanoi(n: int) -> int:\n```\n\n#### Constraints\n- `1 <= n <= 10`",
