    "description": "A harmonious note is a musical note that has both a frequency and an amplitude. The notes are harmonious if the sum of their frequencies equals to their count. Write a function `harmonious_notes` that takes in a list of tuples, where each tuple contains two integers - the frequency and amplitude of a note.\n\n#### Function Signature\n```python\ndef harmonious_notes(notes: list[tuple[int, int]]) -> bool:\n```\n\n#### Input\n- `notes` (list[tuple[int, int]]): A list of tuples, where each tuple contains two integers - the frequency and amplitude of a note.\n\n#### Output\n- Returns `True` if the notes are harmonious, `False` otherwise.",
