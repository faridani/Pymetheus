    "description": "The FizzBuzz problem is a popular interview question that tests a candidate's ability to write clean, concise code. Write a function `fizzbuzz` that iterates over the numbers from 1 to 100 and for each number:\n\n- If the number is divisible by 3, print \"Fizz\".\n- If the number is divisible by 5, print \"Buzz\".\n- If the number is divisible by both 3 and 5, print \"FizzBuzz\".\n- Otherwise, just print the number.\n\n#### Function Signature:\n```python\ndef fizzbuzz() -> None:\n```\n\n#### Input/Output:\nThe function does not take any input. It prints the FizzBuzz sequence to the console.\n\n#### Example:\n```python\nfizzbuzz()\n```\n\nExpected Output:\n```\n1 2 Fizz 4 Buzz ...\n```",
