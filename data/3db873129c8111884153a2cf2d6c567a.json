Write a function `count_char` that takes a string and a character as input and returns the count of the character in the string.\n\n#### Function Signature\n```python\ndef count_char(s: str, c: str)  -> int:\n```\n\n#### Input\n- `s` (str): A string that may contain letters, numbers, and punctuation.\n- `c` (str): The character to be counted in the string.\n\n#### Output\n- Returns an integer representing the number of occurrences of the character `c` in the string `s`.\n",
