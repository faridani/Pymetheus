    "description": "Write a function `is_leap_year` that checks if a given year is a leap year. The function should accept an integer representing the year as input and return `True` if the year is a leap year, `False` otherwise.\n\n#### Function Signature\n```python\ndef is_leap_year(y: int) -> bool:\n```\n\n#### Input\n- `y` (int): A four-digit year.\n\n#### Output\n- Returns `True` if the input year is a leap year, `False` otherwise.\n\n#### Hints\n- To be a leap year, a year must be divisible by 4. However, years that are also divisible by 100 are not leap years unless they are also divisible by 400.\n",
