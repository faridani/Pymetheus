    "title": "Word Wrap Problem (Hard)",
    "description": "Given a long string, your task is to write a function `word_wrap` that wraps the words to a given number of columns. The function should insert line breaks at appropriate places so that no line exceeds the specified column width.\n\n#### Function Signature\n```python\ndef word_wrap(s: str, width: int) -> str:\n```\n\n#### Input\n- `s` (str): A string containing words.\n- `width` (int): The maximum number of columns or characters per line.\n\n#### Output\n- Returns a string with the words wrapped to the specified width, separated by line breaks.\n\n#### Example\nGiven the input: \"Hello, this is a long sentence that needs to be wrapped to a certain column width.\"\nAnd width = 20\nThe output should be:\n\"Hello, this \nis a long \nsentence that \nneeds to be \nwrapped to a \ncertain column \nwidth.\"\n\nHint: You may need to handle cases where words are longer than the specified width.\n",
    "code": "def word_wrap(s: str, width: int) -> str:\n    # Split the string into words\n    words = s.split()\n    \n    # Initialize a flag to track if we are at the start of a new line\n    newline = True\n    \n    # Initialize an empty string to hold the wrapped text\n    wrapped_text = ''\n    \n    # Iterate over each word\n    for word in words:\n        \n        # Check if the current word length plus the current line length is greater than the width\n        if len(word) + len(wrapped_text) > width and not newline:\n            \n            # If so, add a line break and set the flag to True for the next iteration\n            wrapped_text += '\\n'\n            newline = True\n        else:\n            \n            # Otherwise, just append the word to the current line\n            wrapped_text += word + ' '\n            \n            # Set the flag to False for the next iteration\n            newline = False\n    \n    # Return the wrapped text\n    return wrapped_text\n",
