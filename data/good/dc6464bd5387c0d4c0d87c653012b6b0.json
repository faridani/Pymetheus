    "description": "You are given a list of points on the plane. How many distinct triangles can you form with these points?\nA triangle is defined by three different points, and it doesn't matter what order they are in. For example, if you have points (1, 2), (2, 3) and (3, 4), then all of the following tuples would define the same triangle: (1, 2, 3), (1, 3, 2), etc.\n\n#### Function Signature\n```python\ndef count_triangles(points: List[Tuple[int, int]]) -> int:\n```\n\n#### Input\n- `points` (List[Tuple[int, int]]): A list of points on the plane.\n\n#### Output\n- Returns the number of distinct triangles that can be formed with these points.",
