    "description": "The Tower of Hanoi is a classic mathematical puzzle. The goal is to move a stack of disks from one peg to another, with the constraint that smaller disks must always be on top of larger ones. Write a function `move_towers` that takes three parameters: the number of disks, and the starting and target pegs. Your function should return a list of moves required to solve the puzzle.\n\n#### Function Signature\n```python\ndef move_towers(num_disks: int, source_peg: int, target_peg: int) -> List[str]:\n```\n\n#### Input\n- `num_disks` (int): The number of disks. (1 <= num_disks <= 20)\n- `source_peg` (int): The starting peg. (0 <= source_peg < 3)\n- `target_peg` (int): The target peg. (0 <= target_peg < 3, and different from `source_peg`)\n\n#### Output\n- Returns a list of moves in the format `'Move disk <disk_number> from peg <from_peg> to peg <to_peg>'`.",
