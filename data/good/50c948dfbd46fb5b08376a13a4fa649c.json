    "description": "Given two rectangles defined by their coordinates (x1, y1) and (x2, y2), write a function `do_rectangles_overlap` that checks if they overlap. A rectangle is defined by its top-left and bottom-right coordinates.\n\n#### Function Signature\n```python\ndef do_rectangles_overlap(r1: tuple, r2: tuple) -> bool:\n```\n\n#### Input\n- `r1` (tuple): The first rectangle's coordinates `(x1, y1)` and `(x2, y2)`.\n- `r2` (tuple): The second rectangle's coordinates `(x3, y3)` and `(x4, y4)`.\n\n#### Output\n- Returns `True` if the rectangles overlap, `False` otherwise.",
