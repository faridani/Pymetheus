    "title": "Hard: Infinite Palindromic Substrings",
    "description": "\nA palindrome substring is a sequence of characters that reads the same backward as forward and can be found within a string. Consider the function `count_infinite_palindromes(s: str) -> int` which counts all unique substrings in `s` that are palindromes and occur infinitely often in every possible expansion of these substrings.\n\nFor example, if we have a string `\"aba\"`, \"a\", \"b\", and \"a\" are considered as palindromic substrings because they can be expanded infinitely within themselves to form palindromes like \"aa\", \"bb\", etc. If the input is `\"aaa\"`, then all substrings of this string will count towards the infinite occurrences, making its output `6` (`\"a\" * 3`, `\"aa\"`, and `\"aaa\"`).\n\n#### Function Signature\n```python\ndef count_infinite_palindromes(s: str) -> int:\n```\n#### Input\n- `s` (str): A string of lower case letters.\n\n#### Output\n- Returns an integer representing the number of unique substrings in `s` that are palindromic and occur infinitely often in every possible expansion.",
