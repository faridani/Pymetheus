    "description": "\"Find the Textifinite sequence within a given list of integers. A Textifinite sequence is a non-finite sequence that appears infinite but actually terminates.\n\n#### Function Signature\n```python\ndef find_textifinite(numbers: List[int]) -> List[int]:\n```\n\n#### Input\n- `numbers` (List[int]): A non-empty list of integers.\n\n#### Output\n- Returns a list containing the Textifinite sequence if it exists, otherwise returns an empty list.\n\n#### Hints\nA Textifinite sequence is a sequence that appears to be infinite but actually terminates. It can start with any number, and each following number is obtained by adding a constant to the previous number. The constant can be positive or negative, and may not always be the same.",
