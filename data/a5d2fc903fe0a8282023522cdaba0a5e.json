    "description": "Given a list of integers, write a function `count_duplicates` that returns the count of elements with more than one occurrence. Ignore all elements that only appear once.\n\n#### Function Signature\n```python\ndef count_duplicates(numbers: List[int]) -> int:\n```\n\n#### Input\n- `numbers`: A list of integers which may contain duplicates and non-repeated elements. The length of the input list will be between 1 to 10^5.\n\n#### Output\n- Returns an integer representing the count of numbers that appear more than once in the input list.\n",
