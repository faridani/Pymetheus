    "description": "Given an array with odd number of elements, write a function that finds and returns the element that occurs an odd number of times in the array. Assume there is always exactly one such element.\n\n#### Function Signature\n```python\ndef find_odd_occurrences(arr: List[int]) -> int:\n```\n\n#### Input\n- `arr` (List[int]): A list of integers where the length of the list is odd, and there exists exactly one element that occurs an odd number of times.\n\n#### Output\n- Returns the integer that appears an odd number of times in the input array.",
    "code": "from typing import List\ndef find_odd_occurrences(arr: List[int]) -> int:\n    result = 0\n    for num in arr:\n        result ^= num\n    return result",

        "assert find_odd_occurrences([2, 3, 4, 3, 2]) == 4",
