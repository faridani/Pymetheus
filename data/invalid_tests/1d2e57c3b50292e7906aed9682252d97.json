    "description": "Write a function `fizzbuzz` that prints the numbers from 1 to n. For multiples of three print 'Fizz' instead of the number, and for the multiples of five print 'Buzz'. For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print 'FizzBuzz'.\n\n#### Function Signature\n```python\ndef fizzbuzz(n: int) -> None:\n```\n\n#### Input\n- `n` (int): A positive integer.\n\n#### Output\n- The function should print the numbers from 1 to n, but for multiples of three it prints 'Fizz' instead of the number and for multiples of five it prints 'Buzz'. For numbers which are multiples of both three and five it prints 'FizzBuzz'.",
