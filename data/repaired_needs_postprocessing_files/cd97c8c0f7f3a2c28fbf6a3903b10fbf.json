    "title": "Easy: FizzBuzz with a Twist",
    "description": "Write a function `fizzbuzz_with_twist` that takes an integer `n` as input and returns the FizzBuzz sequence up to `n`. The FizzBuzz sequence is a series of numbers from 1 to `n`, where each number is replaced by one of three strings: 'Fizz' if it's divisible by 3, 'Buzz' if it's divisible by 5, or the number itself as a string. However, if a number is divisible by both 3 and 5, your function should return the string 'FizzBuzz'. \n\n#### Function Signature\n```python\ndef fizzbuzz_with_twist(n: int) -> list:\n```\n\n#### Input\n- `n` (int): The last number in the FizzBuzz sequence.\n\n#### Output\n- A list of strings representing the FizzBuzz sequence up to `n`. Each string is either 'Fizz', 'Buzz', or a number as a string.\n",
