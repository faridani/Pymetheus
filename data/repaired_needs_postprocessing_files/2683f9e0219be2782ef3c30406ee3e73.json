    "description": "A perfect number is a positive integer that is equal to the sum of its positive divisors, excluding itself. For example, 6 is a perfect number because its proper divisors are 1, 2, and 3, which add up to 6 (1+2+3=6). Write a function `is_perfect` that checks if a given integer is a perfect number. \n\n#### Function Signature\n```python\ndef is_perfect(n: int) -> bool:\n```\n\n#### Input\n- `n` (int): A positive integer that may be perfect or not.\n\n#### Output\n- Returns `True` if the input integer is a perfect number, `False` otherwise.\n",
    "code": "def is_perfect(n: int) -> bool:\n    # Initialize sum of divisors to 1 (1 is always a divisor)\n    sum_divisors = 1\n    for i in range(2, n):\n        if n % i == 0:\n            sum_divisors += i\n    return sum_divisors == n,\n",
