    "description": "You are given an array of integers representing the heights of plants in a garden. The goal is to find the maximum number of consecutive plants that can be planted in the garden without exceeding a certain height limit.\n\n#### Function Signature\n```python\ndef max_consecutive_plants(heights: list[int], max_height: int) -> int:\n```\n\n#### Input\n- `heights` (list[int]): A list of integers representing the heights of plants.\n- `max_height` (int): The maximum allowed height for consecutive plants.\n\n#### Output\n- Returns the maximum number of consecutive plants that can be planted in the garden without exceeding the given height limit.\n\n#### Constraints\nThe input array is non-empty and contains only positive integers. The maximum height is also a positive integer.\n",
