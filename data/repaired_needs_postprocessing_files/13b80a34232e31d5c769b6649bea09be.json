Write a function `is_leap_year` that determines if a given year is a leap year.\n\n#### Function Signature\n```python\ndef is_leap_year(year: int) -> bool:\n``` \n\n#### Input\n- `year` (int): A positive integer representing the year to check.\n\n#### Output\n- Returns `True` if the input year is a leap year, `False` otherwise.",
