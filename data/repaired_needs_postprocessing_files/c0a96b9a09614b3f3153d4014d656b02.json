    "description": "Write a function `reverse_sentence_case` that takes a string as input and returns the same string with the case of each word reversed. For example, if the input is 'HeLLo World', the output should be 'hElLo wOrLd'. However, for strings like 'HellO wORLD', the output should still be 'hellO world'. \n\n#### Function Signature\n```python\ndef reverse_sentence_case(s: str) -> str:\n```  \n\n#### Input\n- `s` (str): A string containing one or more words, each word may contain any number of alphabets in either case.\n\n#### Output\n- Returns a string with the same content as input, but each word is reversed in case. For example, if the input is 'HeLLo World', the output should be 'hElLo wOrLd'.",
