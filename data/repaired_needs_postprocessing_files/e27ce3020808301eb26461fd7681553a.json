    "title": "Hard - Minimum Time to Make All Strings Equal",
    "description": "You are given a list of strings `strs` and an integer `k`. The task is to find the minimum time required to make all strings equal. You can rearrange the characters in each string to achieve this goal.\n\n#### Function Signature\n```python\ndef min_time_to_make_equal(strs: List[str], k: int) -> int:\n```\n\n#### Input\n- `strs` (List[str]): A list of strings that may contain letters, numbers, and special characters.\n- `k` (int): The number of operations allowed.\n\n#### Output\n- Returns the minimum time required to make all strings equal in terms of the number of operations performed.\n",
