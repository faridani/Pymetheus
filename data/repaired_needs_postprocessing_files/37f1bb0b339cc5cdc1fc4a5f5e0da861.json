    "description": "Given the lengths of three sides of a triangle, determine if they can form a valid triangle. A valid triangle has three sides with a sum of lengths equal to or greater than the longest side length minus the shortest side length. Write a function `is_valid_triangle` that takes three integers as input and returns `True` if they form a valid triangle, `False` otherwise.",
    "code": "def is_valid_triangle(a: int, b: int, c: int) -> bool:\n    # Calculate the longest and shortest side lengths\n    max_side = max(a, b, c)\n    min_side = min(a, b, c)\n    # Check if the longest side minus the shortest side length is less than or equal to the sum of other two sides\n    return a + b > min_side and a + c > min_side and b + c > min_side and max_side - min_side <= a + b + c - max_side",
