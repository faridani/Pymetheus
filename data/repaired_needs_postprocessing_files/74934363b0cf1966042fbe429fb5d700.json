    "description": "Write a function `even_fibonacci_sum` that calculates the sum of all even numbers in the Fibonacci sequence up to and including n (where n is an integer). The sequence starts with 0 and 1. Note that both 0 and 1 are considered to be in the Fibonacci sequence.\n\n#### Function Signature\n```python\ndef even_fibonacci_sum(n: int) -> int:\n```\n\n#### Input\n- `n` (int): A positive integer.\n\n#### Output\n- Returns the sum of all even numbers in the Fibonacci sequence up to and including n.",
