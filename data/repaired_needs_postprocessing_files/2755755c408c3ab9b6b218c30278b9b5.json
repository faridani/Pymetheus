    "description": "Write a function `fizzbuzz` that takes an integer `n` as input and prints the numbers from 1 to `n`. For multiples of 3, print \"Fizz\" instead of the number. For multiples of 5, print \"Buzz\" instead of the number. For numbers which are multiples of both 3 and 5, print \"FizzBuzz\" instead of the number.\n#### Function Signature\n```python\ndef fizzbuzz(n: int) -> None:\n```\n#### Input\n- `n` (int): An integer representing the upper limit of the sequence.\n#### Output\n- Prints numbers from 1 to `n`, replacing multiples of 3 with \"Fizz\", multiples of 5 with \"Buzz\", and multiples of both 3 and 5 with \"FizzBuzz\".
