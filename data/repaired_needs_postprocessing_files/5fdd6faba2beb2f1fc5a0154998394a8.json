    "description": "A happy number is a number defined by the following process: starting with any positive integer, replace the number by the sum of its square digits, and repeat the process until the number equals 1 (where it stays), or it loops endlessly in a cycle which does not include 1. Those numbers for which this process terminates in 1 are happy numbers.\n\n#### Function Signature\n```python\ndef is_happy(s: int) -> bool:\n``` \n\n#### Input\n- `s` (int): A positive integer.\n\n#### Output\n- Returns `True` if the input number is a happy number, `False` otherwise.",
    "code": "def is_happy(n: int) -> bool:\n    seen = set()\n    while n != 1 and n not in seen:\n        seen.add(n)\n        n = sum(int(digit) ** 2 for digit in str(n))\n    return n == 1\n",
