    "description": "Write a function that takes an integer `n` as input and returns the number of times Fizz, Buzz or both appear in the range from 1 to `n`. A Fizz appears every third number, a Buzz appears every fifth number. Both can appear at the same time.\n\n#### Function Signature\n```python\ndef count_fizz_buzz(n: int) -> int:\n```\n\n#### Input\n- `n` (int): The upper limit of the range from 1 to `n`. inclusive.\n\n#### Output\n- Returns the number of times Fizz, Buzz or both appear in the range from 1 to `n`.
