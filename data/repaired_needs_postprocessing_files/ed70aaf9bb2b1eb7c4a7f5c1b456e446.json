    "description": "Given an array of integers, find the length of the longest increasing subsequence.\n\nA subsequence is a sequence that can be derived from the original array by deleting some or no elements without changing the order of the remaining elements. An increasing subsequence is a subsequence where all elements are in strictly increasing order.\n\n#### Function Signature```pythonndef longest_increasing_subsequence(nums: list[int]) -> int:```\n\n#### Input\n- `nums` (list[int]): A list of integers.\n\n#### Output\n- Returns the length of the longest increasing subsequence.",
