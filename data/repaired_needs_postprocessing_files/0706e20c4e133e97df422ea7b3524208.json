    "title": "Medium: Longest Increasing Subsequence",
    "description": "Given an integer array nums, return the length of the longest increasing subsequence.\nA subsequence is a sequence that can be derived from an array by deleting some or no elements without changing the order of the remaining elements. For example, [3,6,2,7] is a subsequence of the array [0,3,1,6,2,2,7].\n\n#### Function Signature\n```python\ndef longest_increasing_subsequence(nums: list[int]) -> int:\n``` \n\n#### Input\n- `nums` (list[int]): A list of integers.\n\n#### Output\n- Returns the length of the longest increasing subsequence.",
