    "description": "Write a function that solves a given Sudoku puzzle. A Sudoku puzzle is represented as a 2D list of integers, where each integer represents the value of a cell in the puzzle. The function should return a solved puzzle. If it's not possible to solve the puzzle, the function should return None.\n\n#### Function Signature\n```python\ndef solve_sudoku(board: List[List[int]]) -> Optional[List[List[int]]]:\n```\n\n#### Input\n- `board` (List[List[int]]): A 2D list of integers representing the Sudoku puzzle. The size of the board is always 9x9.\n\n#### Output\n- Returns a solved Sudoku puzzle as a 2D list of integers, or None if it's not possible to solve the puzzle.\n",
