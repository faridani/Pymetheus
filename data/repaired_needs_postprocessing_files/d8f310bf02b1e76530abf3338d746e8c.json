    "description": "Given an array of integers, find the length of the longest increasing subsequence.\nA sequence is a subsequence of another if it can be obtained by deleting some elements from the original sequence. An increasing subsequence is a sequence where every element is strictly greater than the element before it.\n\n#### Function Signature\n```python\ndef longest_increasing_subsequence(nums: list[int]) -> int:\n```\n\n#### Input\n- `nums` (list[int]): A list of integers.\n\n#### Output\n- Returns the length of the longest increasing subsequence.",
