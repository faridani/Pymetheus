    "description": "The Fibonacci sequence is a series of numbers in which each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, usually starting with 0 and 1. Write a function `fibonacci` that generates the Fibonacci sequence up to the nth term.\n\n#### Function Signature\n```python\ndef fibonacci(n: int) -> List[int]:\n```\n\n#### Input\n- `n` (int): The number of terms you want in your Fibonacci sequence, starting from 0.\n\n#### Output\n- A list containing the first n terms of the Fibonacci sequence.",
