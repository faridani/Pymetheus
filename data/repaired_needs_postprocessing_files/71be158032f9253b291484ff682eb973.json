    "description": "Write a function `fizz_buzz` that takes an integer `n` as input and returns the count of numbers from 1 to `n` that are divisible by either 3 or 5. For example, if `n` is 15, your function should return 8 because there are 8 numbers in the range [1, 15] that are divisible by either 3 or 5: 3, 5, 6, 9, 10, 12, 15.\n\n#### Function Signature\n```python\ndef fizz_buzz(n: int) -> int:\n``` \n\n#### Input\n- `n` (int): An integer greater than 0.",
    "code": "def fizz_buzz(n: int) -> int:\n    count = 0\n    for i in range(1, n+1):\n        if i % 3 == 0 or i % 5 == 0:\n            count += 1\n    return count",
    "tests": [
        "assert fizz_buzz(15) == 8",
