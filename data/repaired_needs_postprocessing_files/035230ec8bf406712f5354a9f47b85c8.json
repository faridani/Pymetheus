    "description": "Goldbach's conjecture states that every even integer greater than 2 can be expressed as the sum of two primes. Write a function `goldbach_conjecture` that takes an input positive integer and returns True if it can be expressed as the sum of two prime numbers, False otherwise.\n#### Function Signature\n```python\ndef goldbach_conjecture(n: int) -> bool:\n```\n#### Input\n- `n` (int): A positive integer greater than 2.\n#### Output\n- Returns `True` if the input number can be expressed as the sum of two prime numbers, `False` otherwise.\n",
