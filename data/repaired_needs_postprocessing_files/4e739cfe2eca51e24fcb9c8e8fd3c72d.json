    "description": "A palindromic subsequence of a string is a sequence that reads the same backward as forward. Write a function `count_palindrome_subsequences` that takes in a string and returns the count of its unique palindromic subsequences.\n\n#### Function Signature\n```python\ndef count_palindrome_subsequences(s: str) -> int:\n```\n\n#### Input\n- `s` (str): A string that may contain letters, numbers, spaces, and punctuation.\n\n#### Output\n- Returns the count of unique palindromic subsequences in the input string.",
