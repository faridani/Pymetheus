    "description": "Given a positive integer `n`, write a function called `count_binary_sequences` that returns the number of distinct binary sequences (0s and 1s) of length `n` having a specific parity. The parity is either odd or even, specified as an argument to the function.\r\n\r\n#### Function Signature\r\n```\ndef count_binary_sequences(n: int, parity: str) -> int:\r\n``` \r\n\r\n#### Input\r\n- `n` (int): The length of the binary sequence.\r\n- `parity` (str): 'odd' or 'even', specifying the required parity of the sequence.\r\n\r\n#### Output\r\n- Returns an integer representing the number of distinct binary sequences with the given parity and length `n`. \r\n",
