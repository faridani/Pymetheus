    "description": "Given a string, write a function `reverseWords` that reverses the order of words in the given string. The input string may contain multiple spaces between words and will not have any leading or trailing spaces.\n\n#### Function Signature\n```python\ndef reverseWords(s: str) -> str:\n```\n\n#### Input\n- `s` (str): A string containing multiple words separated by one or more spaces. The input string will not have any leading or trailing spaces.\n\n#### Output\n- Returns a new string where the order of words is reversed, and no changes are made to individual words.\n",
