    "description": "Write a function `anagram(words1: str, words2: str) -> bool` that checks if two given strings are anagrams of each other.\n\n#### Function Signature\n```python\ndef anagram(words1: str, words2: str) -> bool:\n```\n\n#### Input\n- `words1` (str): A string that may contain only lowercase letters in any order.\n- `words2` (str): Another string that may contain only lowercase letters in any order.\n\n#### Output\n- Returns `True` if the input strings are anagrams of each other, `False` otherwise.\n\n#### Hints:\nThis problem requires creating a dictionary to count the frequency of each letter in both strings and then comparing these dictionaries. If they are equal, the strings are anagrams.",
