    "description": "You are given an array of non-negative integers representing the heights of n flowers. A flower blooms when its height is equal to or greater than k, where k is a given integer. Your goal is to find the minimum time required for all the flowers to bloom.\n\n#### Function Signature\n```python\ndef min_time_to_bloom(flower_heights: list[int], k: int) -> int:\n```\n\n#### Input\n- `flower_heights` (list[int]): A list of non-negative integers representing the heights of n flowers.\n- `k` (int): The minimum height required for a flower to bloom.\n\n#### Output\n- Returns the minimum time required for all the flowers to bloom, or -1 if it's impossible.\n\n",
