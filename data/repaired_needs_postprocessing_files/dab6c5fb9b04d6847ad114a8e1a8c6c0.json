    "description": "#### Problem Description\nGiven a list of integers, calculate the sum of all possible sums that can be formed by adding two numbers from this list. For example, if the input list is [1, 2, 3], then the function should return 1+2+3 = 6.\n\n#### Function Signature\n```python\ndef sum_of_sums(lst: list) -> int:\n```\n\n#### Input\n- `lst` (list): A list of integers that may contain negative numbers.\n\n#### Output\n- Returns the sum of all possible sums that can be formed by adding two numbers from this input list.",
