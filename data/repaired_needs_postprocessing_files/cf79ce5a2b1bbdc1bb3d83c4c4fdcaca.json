    "description": "Write a function `fizzbuzz` that prints the numbers from 1 to n. But for multiples of three print 'Fizz' instead of the number and for multiples of five print 'Buzz'. For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print 'FizzBuzz'.\n\n#### Function Signature\n```\ndef fizzbuzz(n: int) -> None:\n``` \n\n#### Input\n- `n` (int): A positive integer.\n\n#### Output\n- The function should print numbers from 1 to n, replacing multiples of three with 'Fizz', multiples of five with 'Buzz', and multiples of both with 'FizzBuzz'.",
