    "description": "A combination of integers from 1 to n, where m are distinct elements and the remaining k are repeats, is said to be a valid combination if it sums up to a given target number. For example, (1,1,2) and (1,2,1) are both valid combinations for the numbers 1 to 3 with a target sum of 4.\n\n#### Function Signature\n```python\ndef count_valid_combinations(n: int, k: int, t: int) -> int:\n```\n\n#### Input\n- `n` (int): The maximum number in the combination.\n- `k` (int): The number of distinct elements in the combination.\n- `t` (int): The target sum for the combination.\n\n#### Output\n- Returns the number of valid combinations that sum up to the target number.",
