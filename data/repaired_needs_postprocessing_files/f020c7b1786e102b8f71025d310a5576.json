Write a function `num_distinct_subseq` that takes as input a string and returns the number of distinct subsequences in that string.\n\n#### Function Signature\n```python\ndef num_distinct_subseq(s: str) -> int:\n``` \n\n#### Input\n- `s` (str): A string that may contain letters, numbers, spaces, and punctuation.\n\n#### Output\n- Returns the number of distinct subsequences in the input string.",
