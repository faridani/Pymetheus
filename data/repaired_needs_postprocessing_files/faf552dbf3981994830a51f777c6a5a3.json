    "description": "Given an array of integers representing the lengths of three sides of triangles, write a function `count_triangles` that counts the number of valid triangles. A triangle is considered valid if its sides satisfy the triangle inequality: the sum of any two sides must be greater than the third side.\n\n#### Function Signature\n```python\ndef count_triangles(sides: list[int]) -> int:\n```\n\n#### Input\n- `sides` (list[int]): A list of three integers representing the lengths of the sides of a triangle.\n\n#### Output\n- Returns the number of valid triangles that can be formed using the given sides.",
