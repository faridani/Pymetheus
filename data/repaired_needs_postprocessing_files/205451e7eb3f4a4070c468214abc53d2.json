He wants to build fences around each row, and he needs your help to count the number of possible fence configurations.\n#### Function Signature\n```python\ndef count_fences(n: int) -> int:\n```\n#### Input\n- `n` (int): The number of rows in Farmer John's field.\n#### Output\n- Returns the total number of possible fence configurations.\n",
