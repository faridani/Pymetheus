    "description": "Write a function `fact_sum` that takes an integer `n` as input and returns the sum of all factorials from 1 to `n`. The factorial of a number is calculated by multiplying all positive integers less than or equal to that number.\r\n\r\n#### Function Signature\r\n```python\ndef fact_sum(n: int) -> int:\r``` \r\n\r\n#### Input\r\n- `n` (int): An integer greater than 0.\r\n\r\n#### Output\r\n- Returns the sum of all factorials from 1 to `n`.",
