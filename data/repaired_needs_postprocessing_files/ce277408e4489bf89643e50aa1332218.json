In this context, words are any sequences of non-space characters. The spaces between the words should be preserved.\n\n#### Function Signature\n```python\ndef reverse_words(s: str) -> str:\n```\n\n#### Input\n- `s` (str): A string containing words separated by spaces and possibly other non-word characters such as punctuation.\n\n#### Output\n- Returns a string where the order of the words is reversed, but the order of the characters within each word is unchanged.",
