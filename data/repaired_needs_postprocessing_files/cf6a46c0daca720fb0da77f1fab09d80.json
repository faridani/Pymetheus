    "description": "Write a function `reverse_words` that takes a string as input and returns the same string with the words reversed, but preserving spaces and punctuation. The order of words should be reversed, for example 'Hello World' would become 'World Hello'. If there is only one word in the input, it should remain unchanged.\n\n#### Function Signature\n```python\ndef reverse_words(s: str) -> str:\n```\n\n#### Input\n- `s` (str): A string that contains one or more words separated by spaces and/or punctuation characters.\n\n#### Output\n- Returns the input string with the words reversed in order, preserving spaces and punctuation.",
