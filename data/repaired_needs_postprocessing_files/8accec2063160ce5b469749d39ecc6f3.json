    "description": "Given a positive integer n, write a function `sum_of_consecutive_odds(n)` that returns the sum of all consecutive odd numbers starting from 1 up to and including n. You can assume that n will be an integer greater than or equal to 1. Write a function signature for this problem and test cases.\n\n#### Function Signature\n```python\ndef sum_of_consecutive_odds(n: int) -> int:\n```\n\n#### Input\n- `n` (int): A positive integer greater than or equal to 1.\n\n#### Output\n- Returns the sum of all consecutive odd numbers starting from 1 up to and including n.\n",
