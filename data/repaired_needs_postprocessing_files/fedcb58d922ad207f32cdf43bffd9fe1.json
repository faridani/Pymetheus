    "description": "Write a function `are_words_reversed` that checks if the words in a given sentence are reversed. For this problem, we consider a word to be any sequence of non-space characters. A sentence is reversed if each word in it reads backwards from left to right when compared with its corresponding word read from right to left.\n\n#### Function Signature\n```\ndef are_words_reversed(sentence: str) -> bool:\n``` \n\n#### Input\n- `sentence` (str): A non-empty string that contains words separated by one or more spaces.\n\n#### Output\n- Returns `True` if the input sentence's words are reversed, `False` otherwise.",
