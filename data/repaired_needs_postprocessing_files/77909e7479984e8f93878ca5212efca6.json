    "description": "Write a function `count_char` that takes two arguments:\n1. A string `s`. \n2. A character `c`.The function should return the number of times the character `c` appears in the string `s`. You can assume that the input string and character are already defined.\n#### Function Signature\n```python\ndef count_char(s: str, c: str) -> int:\n```\n#### Input\n- `s` (str): The input string.\n- `c` (str): The character to count.\n#### Output\n- Returns the number of times `c` appears in `s`.",
