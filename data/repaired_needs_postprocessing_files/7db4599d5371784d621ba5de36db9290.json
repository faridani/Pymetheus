    "title": "Medium: Sum of Distances to Average",
    "description": "Given an array of integers, calculate the sum of distances from each element to the average of all elements. For example, if the array is [1, 2, 3], the distance from 1 to the average (which is (1+2+3)/3 = 2) is |1-2| = 1. The distance from 2 to the average is |2-2| = 0 and the distance from 3 to the average is |3-2| = 1. The sum of these distances is 1 + 0 + 1 = 2.\n\n#### Function Signature\n```python\ndef sum_of_distances(arr: list[int)) -> int:\n``` \n\n#### Input\n- `arr` (list[int]): A list of integers.\n\n#### Output\n- Returns the sum of distances from each element in the array to the average of all elements.",
    "code": "def sum_of_distances(arr: list[int]) -> int:\n    n = len(arr)\n    avg = sum(arr) / n\n    return sum(abs(x - avg) for x in arr)",
