    "description": "Given a 2D binary matrix `matrix` where each element is either 0 (representing an empty cell) or 1 (representing a live cell),\n#### Input\n- `matrix` (list of lists): A 2D binary matrix where each element is either 0 or 1.\n#### Output\n- Returns an integer representing the maximum area that can be obtained by flipping at most one 0-cell in the given matrix.\n#### Constraints and Hints\n- You can only flip at most one 0-cell to get the maximal rectangle.\n- The size of the matrix is between 1x1 and 100x100.\n- You are allowed to use a height map approach for this problem.",
