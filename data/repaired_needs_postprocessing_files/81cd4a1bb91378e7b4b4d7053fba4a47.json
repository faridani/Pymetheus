    "description": "Write a function `reverse_words` that takes a string as input and returns the same string but with each word reversed (in place). The words are defined by spaces, commas, periods, question marks, exclamation points or any other whitespace characters. However, do not reverse the order of the individual characters within the words.\n\n#### Function Signature\n```python\ndef reverse_words(s: str) -> str:\n``` \n\n#### Input\n- `s` (str): A string that may contain letters, numbers, spaces, and punctuation.\n\n#### Output\n- Returns the input string where each word is reversed in place, but the order of characters within the words remains the same.",
