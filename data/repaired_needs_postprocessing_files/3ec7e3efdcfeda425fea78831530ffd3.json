    "description": "A gardener has n flowers, and it takes m minutes for each flower to bloom. The gardener can only water one row of flowers at a time. Write a function `min_time` that calculates the minimum time needed to make all the flowers bloom.\n\n#### Function Signature\n```python\ndef min_time(n: int, m: int) -> int:\n```\n\n#### Input\n- `n` (int): The number of flowers.\n- `m` (int): The minutes it takes for each flower to bloom.\n\n#### Output\n- Returns the minimum time needed to make all the flowers bloom.\n",
