    "description": "Chef Emma has a recipe for the perfect cake. The recipe requires that she adds 1/3 of the total weight of the batter, 2/5 of the total weight of the batter, and 1/7 of the total weight of the batter to make up the remaining weight of the batter. Write a function `check_recipe` that checks if a given set of weights satisfies Chef Emma's recipe.\n\n#### Function Signature\n```python\ndef check_recipe(a: int, b: int) -> bool:\n```\n\n#### Input\n- `a` (int): The weight of the first addition in grams.\n- `b` (int): The total weight of the batter in grams.\n\n#### Output\n- Returns `True` if the given weights satisfy Chef Emma's recipe, `False` otherwise.\n",
