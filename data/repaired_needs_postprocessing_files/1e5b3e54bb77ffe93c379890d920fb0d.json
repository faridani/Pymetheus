    "description": "Write a function `fibonacci` that generates the Fibonacci sequence up to a given number. The Fibonacci sequence is a series of numbers in which each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, usually starting with 0 and 1.\n#### Function Signature\n```python\ndef fibonacci(n: int) -> list:\n``` \n\n#### Input\n- `n` (int): A positive integer that specifies the number of Fibonacci numbers to generate.\n\n#### Output\n- Returns a list containing the first `n` Fibonacci numbers.",
