    "description": "Given an unsorted array of integers, find the length of the longest increasing subsequence. An increasing subsequence is a sequence that consists of elements in sorted order, lowest to highest, and where each element appears only once.\n\n#### Function Signature\n```python\ndef length_of_LIS(nums: List[int]) -> int:\n```\n\n#### Input\n- `nums` (List[int]): A list of integers, which may contain duplicates. The array can be as large as 10^4.\n\n#### Output\n- Returns the length of the longest increasing subsequence in the input list.",
