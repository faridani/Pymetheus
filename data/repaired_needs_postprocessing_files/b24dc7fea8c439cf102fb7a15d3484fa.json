    "description": "The Fibonacci sequence is a series of numbers in which each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, usually starting with 0 and 1. Write a recursive function `fibonacci` that calculates the nth number of the Fibonacci sequence.\n#### Function Signature\n```python\ndef fibonacci(n: int) -> int:\n```\n\n#### Input\n- `n` (int): The position of the desired Fibonacci number in the sequence.\n\n#### Output\n- Returns the nth Fibonacci number as an integer.\n\n#### Constraints and hints\n- If `n` is less than 0, return -1.\n- If `n` is greater than or equal to 2, return the nth Fibonacci number. For example:\n    fibonacci(3) = 2 (the third number in the sequence is 2)\n",
