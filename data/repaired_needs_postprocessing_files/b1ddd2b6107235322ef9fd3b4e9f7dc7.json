    "description": "Given an undirected graph represented as an adjacency list, find the maximum size of any connected component. An adjacency list representation is an abstract data type that represents a finite graph as a collection of arrays, where each array represents the set of vertices adjacent to a given vertex.\n\n#### Function Signature\n```python\ndef max_island_size(graph: dict) -> int:\n```\n\n#### Input\n- `graph` (dict): An adjacency list representation of an undirected graph. Each key is a node, and its corresponding value is a list of nodes that are directly connected to it.\n\n#### Output\n- Returns the maximum size of any connected component in the input graph.\n\nFor example, if the input graph is:\n```python\n{   'A': ['B', 'C'],\n    'B': ['A', 'D', 'E'],\n    'C': ['A', 'F'],\n    'D': ['B'],\n    'E': ['B', 'F'],\n    'F': ['C', 'E']\n}\n```then the function should return 6, because there is one connected component of size 6 (the subgraph containing nodes A-F).\n",
