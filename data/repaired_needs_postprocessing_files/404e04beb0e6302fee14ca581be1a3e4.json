    "title": "'Stack of Plates' - An Easy Problem",
    "description": "A stack of plates is a series of plates arranged in a vertical stack, with each plate being placed above another. Write a function `isValidStack` that takes a list of integers as input and checks if the list represents a valid stack of plates. This function should return `True` if the input list represents a valid stack of plates, `False` otherwise. A valid stack of plates must follow these rules: - The number of plates in the stack is finite and positive (greater than 0). - Each plate must have a diameter greater than or equal to the one below it in the stack. In other words, for two consecutive integers `i` and `i+1`, we have `stack[i] >= stack[i+1]`.",
    "code": "def isValidStack(stack: List[int]) -> bool:\n    # Loop through the list\n    for i in range(1, len(stack)):\n        # If the current plate's diameter is smaller than the previous one, return False\n        if stack[i] < stack[i-1]:\n            return False\n    # If we looped through the entire list without finding any invalid stacks, return True\n    return True",
    "tests": [
        "assert isValidStack([5, 3, 4, 2]) == True",
        "assert isValidStack([5, 1, 9]) == False",
        "assert IsValidStack([6, 3, 7, 8]) == False"
