    "description": "Write a function `sum_of_multiples` that calculates the sum of all multiples of a given number up to and including a specified limit.\n\n#### Function Signature\n```python\ndef sum_of_multiples(limit: int, multiple: int) -> int:\n```\n\n#### Input\n- `limit` (int): The upper bound of the multiples to consider. All numbers up to and including this value will be checked.\n- `multiple` (int): The number whose multiples will be added up.\n\n#### Output\n- Returns the sum of all multiples of `multiple` up to and including `limit`.
