    "description": "Write a function `count_vowels` that takes in a string and returns the number of vowels (a, e, i, o, u) found in it. The input string may contain both uppercase and lowercase letters, spaces, and punctuation.\n\n#### Function Signature\n```python\ndef count_vowels(s: str) -> int:\n```\n\n#### Input\n- `s` (str): A string containing any number of characters.\n\n#### Output\n- Returns the total count of vowels found in the input string.\n\n#### Constraints\n1. The length of the string is between 1 and 1000 characters, inclusive.\n2. The string can contain uppercase and lowercase letters, spaces, and punctuation.\n\n#### Hints\nConsider using a set to store vowel characters for faster lookup, iterate over each character in the input string, convert it to lowercase, check if it's a vowel, and increment a counter accordingly.",
