    "description": "A farmer has n eggs to deliver to m customers. Each egg can be delivered in one of two ways: directly or through an intermediate customer (which takes twice the time). The farmer wants to find the minimum time required to deliver all eggs. Write a function `egg_delivery_time` that calculates this minimum time.\n\n#### Function Signature\n```python\ndef egg_delivery_time(n: int, m: int) -> int:\n``` \n\n#### Input\n- `n` (int): The number of eggs.\n- `m` (int): The number of customers.\n\n#### Output\n- Returns the minimum time required to deliver all eggs in seconds. Each delivery takes 1 second, and each intermediate customer takes 2 seconds.",
