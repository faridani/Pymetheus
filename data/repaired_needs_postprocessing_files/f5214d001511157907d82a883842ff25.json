    "description": "The Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) is a classic problem in computer science and operations research. Given a set of cities and the distances between each pair of cities, the task is to find the shortest possible route that visits each city exactly once and returns to the starting city.\n#### Function Signature\n```python\ndef tsp(cities: list[tuple[int, int]]) -> tuple[int, list[int]]:\n    # cities: A list of tuples, where each tuple contains the x and y coordinates of a city\n    # Returns: A tuple containing the total distance of the shortest route and the route itself as a list of city indices\n```",
