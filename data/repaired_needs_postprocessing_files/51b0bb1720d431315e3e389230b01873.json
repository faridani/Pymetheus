    "description": "A string consists of lowercase English letters, digits, and punctuation symbols. Find the number of non-empty palindromic substrings in the given string.\n\n#### Function Signature\n```python\ndef count_palindromes(s: str) -> int:\n``` \n\n#### Input\n- `s` (str): A string that may contain letters, numbers, spaces, and punctuation.\n\n#### Output\n- Returns an integer representing the number of non-empty palindromic substrings in the input string.\n\n#### Constraints and Hints\n- The time complexity should be O(N^2) or better.\n- The space complexity should be O(N).\n",
