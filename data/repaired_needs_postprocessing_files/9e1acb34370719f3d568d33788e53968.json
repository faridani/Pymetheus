The Fibonacci sequence is a series of numbers where a number is the addition of the last two numbers, starting with 0 and 1.\n#### Function Signature\n```python\ndef fibonacci(n: int) -> list:\n```\n\n#### Input\n- `n` (int): The maximum number in the Fibonacci sequence to generate.\n\n#### Output\n- Returns a list of integers representing the generated Fibonacci sequence up to and including `n`.\n",
