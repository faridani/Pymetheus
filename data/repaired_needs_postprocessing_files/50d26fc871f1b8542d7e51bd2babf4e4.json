    "description": "The game of guessing a number between 1 and 100 is played as follows:\n- The computer thinks of a random integer between 1 and 100.\n- You make a guess, and the computer tells you whether your guess is higher or lower than the number it has thought of.\n- You keep making guesses until you get the correct answer.\n\nWrite a function `guess_the_number` that simulates this game. It should take one input:\n#### Input\n- `tries`: The maximum number of attempts allowed to guess the number.\n#### Output\n- The final message indicating whether the player guessed correctly or not.",
