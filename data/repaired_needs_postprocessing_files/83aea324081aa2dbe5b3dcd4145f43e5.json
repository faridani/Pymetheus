    "title": "Hard Problem: Minimum Cost to Connect Ropes",
    "description": "Given N ropes of different lengths, the task is to connect these ropes into one rope. The cost required to connect two ropes is equal to the sum of their lengths. The cost of connecting all the ropes will be the total cost for the process.\nWrite a function `min_cost` that takes an array of integers `ropes` where each integer represents the length of a rope and returns an integer representing the minimum cost to connect all the ropes into one rope.\n#### Function Signature\n```python\ndef min_cost(ropes: List[int]) -> int:\n```\n\n#### Input\n- `ropes` (List[int]): An array of integers where each integer represents the length of a rope.\n#### Output\n- Returns an integer representing the minimum cost to connect all the ropes into one rope.",
