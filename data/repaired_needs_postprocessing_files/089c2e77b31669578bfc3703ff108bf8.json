    "description": "The Fibonacci sequence is a series of numbers in which each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, usually starting with 0 and 1. In this problem, we are interested in finding the even-valued Fibonacci numbers and their sum.\n\n#### Function Signature\n```python\ndef fib_sum(n: int) -> int:\n``` \n\n#### Input\n- `n` (int): The maximum number of terms to include in the Fibonacci sequence.\n\n#### Output\n- Returns the sum of all even-valued Fibonacci numbers up to and including the nth term.",
