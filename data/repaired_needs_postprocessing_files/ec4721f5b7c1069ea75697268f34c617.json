    "description": "Write a function `harmonious_melody` that takes two lists of integers, `notes1` and `notes2`, representing musical notes. The function should return the sum of all harmonious melodies created by combining each note from `notes1` with every note from `notes2`. A melody is considered harmonious if it consists of only one type of note (i.e., all notes are the same or there are no notes at all). #### Function Signature```python def harmonious_melody(notes1: list[int], notes2: list[int]) -> int: ``` #### Input - `notes1` (list[int]): A list of integers representing musical notes. - `notes2` (list[int]): A list of integers representing musical notes. #### Output - The sum of all harmonious melodies created by combining each note from `notes1` with every note from `notes2`.",
