For multiples of five print 'Buzz'. For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print 'FizzBuzz'.\n#### Function Signature\n```python\ndef fizz_buzz(n: int) -> None:\n``` \n#### Input\n- `n` (int): A positive integer.\n#### Output\n- Prints a sequence of numbers from 1 to n, with the given Fizz Buzz rules applied.",
