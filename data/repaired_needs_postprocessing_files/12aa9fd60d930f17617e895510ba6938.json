    "description": "Write a function `reversed_words` that checks if a given string, after removing all non-alphabetic characters and spaces, is equal to its reversed version, where each word in the original string is reversed. Words are separated by any number of spaces.\n\n#### Function Signature\n```python\ndef reversed_words(s: str) -> bool:\n```\n\n#### Input\n- `s` (str): A string that may contain letters, numbers, punctuation, and spaces.\n\n#### Output\n- Returns `True` if the input string, after processing as described above, is equal to its reversed version where each word in the original string is reversed. Returns `False` otherwise.",
