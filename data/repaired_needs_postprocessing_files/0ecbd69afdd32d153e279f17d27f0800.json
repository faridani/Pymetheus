Write a function `divisible_sum` that calculates this sum.\n\n#### Function Signature\n```python\ndef divisible_sum(n: int) -> int:\n```\n\n#### Input\n- `n` (int): The upper limit of the range to consider (in this case, 1000).\n\n#### Output\n- Returns the sum of all numbers between 1 and `n` that are divisible by either 3 or 5, but not both.\n",
