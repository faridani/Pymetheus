    "description": "Given an array of integers, find the length of the longest increasing subsequence (LIS). An increasing subsequence is a sequence where each element in the sequence is larger than its predecessor. The problem should be solved using Dynamic Programming.\n\n#### Function Signature\n```python\ndef lis_length(nums: List[int]) -> int:\n```  \n\n#### Input\n- `nums` (List[int]): A list of integers. The length of the list is between 1 and 20, inclusive.\n\n#### Output\n- Returns an integer representing the length of the longest increasing subsequence in the input list.",
