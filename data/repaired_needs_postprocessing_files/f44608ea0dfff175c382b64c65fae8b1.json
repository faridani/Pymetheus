    "description": "Given a string, check if each word in the string reads the same forwards and backwards (ignoring spaces). Words can contain alphanumeric characters. Multiple words are separated by a single space.\n\n#### Function Signature\n```python\ndef reverse_words(s: str) -> bool:\n``` \n\n#### Input\n- `s` (str): A string that contains one or more words, each word is made of alphanumeric characters and separated by a single space.\n\n#### Output\n- Returns `True` if every word in the input string reads the same forwards and backwards, `False` otherwise.",
