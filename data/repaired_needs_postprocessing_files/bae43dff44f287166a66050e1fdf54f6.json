    "description": "Write a function `fizzbuzz` that takes an integer `n` as input and returns the number of times 'Fizz', 'Buzz' or both appear in the sequence from 1 to `n`. The sequence is constructed according to the following rules:\r\n- If the number is divisible by 3, it should be replaced with 'Fizz'.\r\n- If the number is divisible by 5, it should be replaced with 'Buzz'.\r\n- If the number is divisible by both 3 and 5, it should be replaced with 'FizzBuzz'.\r\n\r\n#### Function Signature\r\n```python\r\ndef fizzbuzz(n: int) -> int:\r```\r\r\n#### Input\r\n- `n` (int): A positive integer.\r\r\n#### Output\r\n- Returns the number of times 'Fizz', 'Buzz' or both appear in the sequence from 1 to `n`.\\",
