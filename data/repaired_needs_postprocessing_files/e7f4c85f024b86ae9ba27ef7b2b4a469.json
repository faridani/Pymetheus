    "description": "A perfect cuboid is a three-dimensional integer rectangle with positive integer side lengths (l), (w), and (h), such that the sum of the areas of its 6 faces equals exactly twice the volume. Given integers (a) and (b) representing dimensions of one face, write a function `is_perfect_cuboid(l: int, w: int, h: int) -> bool` that returns True if there exists at least one cuboid with integer side lengths where (l <= w < h), such that the sum of its surface area equals twice its volume and (a <= l*w + w*h + h*l <= b) for both faces (lw), (wh) and (lh). The function should return False otherwise.",
