    "description": "You are given a 2D grid where each cell contains either 0 or 1. A cell containing 1 represents an island, and a cell containing 0 represents water. Write a function that takes the size of the grid and the grid itself as input, and returns the number of islands in the grid.\n\n#### Function Signature\n```python\ndef count_islands(grid_size: tuple, grid: list) -> int:\n```\n\n#### Input\n- `grid_size` (tuple): A tuple containing two integers representing the width and height of the grid.\n- `grid` (list): A 2D list where each cell contains either 0 or 1.\n\n#### Output\n- Returns the number of islands in the grid.\n",
