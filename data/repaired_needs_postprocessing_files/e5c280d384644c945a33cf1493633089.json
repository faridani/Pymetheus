    "description": "You are given an array prices where prices[i] is the price of a stock on the ith day. On each day, you may decide to buy and/or sell the stock. You can only hold at most one share of the stock at any time. However, you can buy it then immediately sell it on the same day.\n\nDesign an algorithm to find the maximum profit from these transactions.\n\n#### Function Signature\n```\npython\ndef maxProfit(prices: List[int]) -> int:\n``` \n\n#### Input\n- `prices` (List[int]): A list of integers where prices[i] is the price of a stock on the ith day.\n\n#### Output\n- Returns an integer representing the maximum profit that can be made from buying and selling stocks.",
