The words are separated by any whitespace character (spaces, tabs, newlines).\n\n#### Function Signature\n```python\ndef reverse_words(s: str) -> str:\n```\n\n#### Input\n- `s` (str): A string that may contain letters, numbers, spaces, and punctuation.\n\n#### Output\n- Returns a string where the order of the words is reversed but the original case of each character is preserved.",
