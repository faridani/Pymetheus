    "description": "A cuboid is a three-dimensional shape with all sides being rectangles. It has length, width and height. The volume of a cuboid is calculated as the product of its length, width and height.\nWrite a function `cuboid_volume` that calculates the volume of a given cuboid.\n\n#### Function Signature\n```\ndef cuboid_volume(length: int, width: int, height: int) -> int:\n``` \n\n#### Input\n- `length` (int): The length of the cuboid.\n- `width` (int): The width of the cuboid.\n- `height` (int): The height of the cuboid.\n\n#### Output\n- Returns the volume of the cuboid as an integer.\n",
    "code": "def cuboid_volume(length: int, width: int, height: int) -> int:\n    return length * width * height",
