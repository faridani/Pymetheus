    "description": "You are given a list of integers representing the x-coordinates of points on a 2D plane. Write a function `count_triangles` that counts the number of possible triangles that can be formed using these points.\n\n#### Function Signature\n```python\ndef count_triangles(points: list[int]) -> int:\n``` \n\n#### Input\n- `points` (list[int]): A list of integers representing the x-coordinates of points on a 2D plane. The list contains at least three elements.\n\n#### Output\n- Returns the number of possible triangles that can be formed using these points.",
