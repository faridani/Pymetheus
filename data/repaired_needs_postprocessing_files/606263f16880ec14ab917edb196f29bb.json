    "description": "Write a function `fizzbuzz` that takes an integer `n` as input and prints the numbers from 1 to n. For each number:\n- If it is divisible by 3, print \"Fizz\" instead of the number.\n- If it is divisible by 5, print \"Buzz\" instead of the number.\n- If it is divisible by both 3 and 5, print \"FizzBuzz\" instead of the number.\n\n#### Function Signature```python\ndef fizzbuzz(n: int):\n```\n\n#### Input\n- `n` (int): A positive integer.\n\n#### Output\n- Prints the numbers from 1 to n, with \"Fizz\", \"Buzz\", and \"FizzBuzz\" substitutions as described above.",
