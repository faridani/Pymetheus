The Fizz Buzz sequence is a series of numbers where each number is described as one of three things:\n* If the number is divisible by 3, say 'Fizz'\n* If the number is divisible by 5, say 'Buzz'\n* If the number is divisible by both 3 and 5, say 'FizzBuzz'\n\n#### Function Signature\n```python\ndef fizz_buzz(n: int) -> str:\n```\n\n#### Input\n- `n` (int): An integer that specifies the length of the Fizz Buzz sequence.\n\n#### Output\n- A string containing the Fizz Buzz sequence up to `n`, where each number is replaced by its corresponding Fizz Buzz description.\n",
