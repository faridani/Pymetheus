    "description": "Given an array of integers, find the length of the longest increasing subsequence. A subsequence is a sequence of numbers that are not necessarily contiguous but appear in the same order as they do in the original array.\n\n#### Function Signature\n```python\ndef longest_increasing_subsequence(nums: list[int]) -> int:\n``` \n\n#### Input\n- `nums` (list[int]): A list of integers.\n\n#### Output\n- Returns the length of the longest increasing subsequence.",
