    "description": "Create a function named `generate_mad_lib` that takes a string as input and replaces missing noun, verb, adjective, and adverb placeholders with random words from the English language.\n\n#### Function Signature\n```python\ndef generate_mad_lib(template: str) -> str:\n```\n\n#### Input\n- `template` (str): A string that contains four placeholders for noun, verb, adjective and adverb. Each placeholder is surrounded by double braces like `{{noun}}`, `{{verb}}`, `{{adjective}}`, or `{{adverb}}`. The template may contain additional text between the placeholders.\n\n#### Output\n- Returns a string where the placeholders are replaced with random words from the English language, ensuring the sentence remains grammatically correct. Use the following dictionary to find synonyms:\n```python\nADJECTIVES = ['happy', 'sad', 'blue', 'big']\nNOUNS = ['car', 'cat', 'tree', 'bottle']\nVERBS = ['runs', 'jumps', 'eats', 'laughs']\nADVERBS = ['quickly', 'slowly', 'carefully', 'hastily']\n```\n",
