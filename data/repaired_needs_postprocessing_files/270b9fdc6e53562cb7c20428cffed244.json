    "description": "Write a function `min_eggs` that takes as input two integers, `n` and `k`, representing the number of floors in a building and the desired number of eggs to use. The function should return the minimum number of eggs needed to guarantee that at most `k` floors need to be tested by dropping an egg from a higher floor to determine whether it is safe or not.\n\n#### Function Signature\n```python\ndef min_eggs(n: int, k: int) -> int:\n``` \n\n#### Input\n- `n` (int): The number of floors in the building.\n- `k` (int): The desired number of eggs to use.\n\n#### Output\n- Returns the minimum number of eggs needed to guarantee that at most `k` floors need to be tested.",
