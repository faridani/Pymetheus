    "description": "A polygon is a closed shape made up of line segments that meet at their endpoints. Write a function `perimeter` that calculates the perimeter of a given polygon. The function takes as input a list of tuples, where each tuple represents an edge of the polygon. Each edge is defined by its two endpoints, which are themselves represented as tuples of x and y coordinates.\n#### Function Signature\n```pythonndef perimeter(edges: List[tuple]) -> float:```\n\n#### Input\n- `edges` (List[tuple]): A list of edges, where each edge is a tuple of two points, and each point is a tuple of x and y coordinates.\n\n#### Output\n- Returns the perimeter of the polygon.",
