    "title": "Hard - Longest Increasing Subsequence",
    "description": "Given an array of integers `nums`, find the length of the longest increasing subsequence. A subsequence is a sequence that can be derived from an array by deleting some or no elements without changing the order of the remaining elements. For example, [1, 3, 2] is a subsequence of [1, 2, 3, 4]. An increasing subsequence is a subsequence where the elements are in strictly increasing order. #### Function Signature```pythondef longest_increasing_subsequence(nums: list[int]) -> int: ``` #### Input- `nums` (list[int]): A list of integers. #### Output- Returns the length of the longest increasing subsequence in `nums`.
