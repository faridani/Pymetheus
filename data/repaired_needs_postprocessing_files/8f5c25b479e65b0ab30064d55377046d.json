    "title": "Maximum Sum of Arithmetic Progression",
    "description": "An arithmetic progression (AP) is a sequence of numbers where each term after the first is obtained by adding a fixed constant to the previous term. For example, 2, 5, 8, 11, 14 is an AP with common difference 3. The maximum sum of APs that can be formed using n distinct integers from 1 to m (inclusive) is unknown.\nWrite a function `max_sum_of_ap` that returns the maximum sum of APs that can be formed using n distinct integers from 1 to m (inclusive).\n#### Function Signature\n```\ndef max_sum_of_ap(n: int, m: int) -> int:\n``` \n\n#### Input\n- `n` (int): The number of distinct integers to use.\n- `m` (int): The upper bound for the integers.\n\n#### Output\n- Returns an integer representing the maximum sum of APs that can be formed using n distinct integers from 1 to m (inclusive).",
