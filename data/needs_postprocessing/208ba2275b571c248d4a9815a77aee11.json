A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself. Write a function `generate_primes` that takes an integer as input and returns a list of all prime numbers less than or equal to the input.\\\\\", \\\\\"function_signature\\\\\": \\\\\"def generate_primes(max_num: int) -> List[int]:\\\\\", \\\\\"input_format\\\\\": \\\\\"- An integer (max_num): The maximum number up to which you need to find prime numbers.

The input number can be quite large, so your solution should aim to be efficient. Avoid using brute-force methods that have high time complexity.\\\\\\\\n2.
