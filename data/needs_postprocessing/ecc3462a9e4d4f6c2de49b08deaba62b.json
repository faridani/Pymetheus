A palindrome is a word, phrase, number, or other sequence of characters that reads the same forward and backward (ignoring spaces, punctuation, and capitalization). An anagram is a word or phrase formed by rearranging the letters of a different word or phrase, typically using all the original letters exactly once.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n#### Function Signature\\\\\\\\n```python\\\\\\\\ndef find_anagrams(words: List[str]) -> Dict[str, List[str]]:\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n#### Input\\\\\\\\n- `words` (List[str]): A list of strings that may contain letters, numbers, spaces, and punctuation.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n#### Output\\\\\\\\n- Returns a dictionary where the keys are palindromes and the values are the anagrams of those palindromes.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\", \\\\\"code\\\\\": \\\\\"import collections\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\ndef find_anagrams(words: List[str]) -> Dict[str, List[str]]:\\\\\\\\n    # Create a dictionary to store palindromes and their anagrams\\\\\\\\n    palindrome_dict = {\\\\\\\\n        \\'\\': []\\\\\\\\n    }\\\\\\\\n    # Convert all words to lowercase and remove non-alphanumeric characters\\\\\\\\n    word_set = set(\\\\\\\\n        char for w in words\\\\\\\\n            for char in w.lower().translate(str.maketrans(\\'\\', \\'\\', string.punctuation))\\\\\\\\n    )\\\\\\\\n    \\\\\\\\n    # Iterate through each possible palindrome length\\\\\\\\n    for length in range(1, len(words) + 1):\\\\\\\\n        # Iterate through each combination of letters of the given length\\\\\\\\n        for comb in combinations(word_set, length):\\\\\\\\n            # Create a candidate palindrome\\\\\\\\n            candidate = \\'\\'.join(comb)\\\\\\\\n            # Check if the candidate is also the reverse of itself\\\\\\\\n            if candidate == candidate[::-1]:\\\\\\\\n                # Add it to the dictionary of palindromes\\\\\\\\n                palindrome_dict[candidate] = []\\\\\\\\n                # Continue to the next combination\\\\\\\\n                continue\\\\\\\\n            \\\\\\\\n            # Check if the remaining characters form an anagram of any palindrome in the dictionary\\\\\\\\n            for palindrome, anagrams in palindrome_dict.items():\\\\\\\\n                if len(comb) == len(palindrome):\\\\\\\\n                    anagram = set(comb) - set(palindrome)\\\\\\\\n                    # If there is no anagram left, add the current combination to the value of the palindrome in the dictionary\\\\\\\\n                    if not anagram:\\\\\\\\n                        anagrams.append(\\'\\'.join(comb))\\\\\\\\n\\\\\", \\\\\"tests\\\\\": [\\\\\"assert find_anagrams([\\\\\\\\\\\\\"racecar\\\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\\\"level\\\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\\\"deified\\\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\\\"did\\\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\\\"deify\\\\\\\\\\\\\"]) == {\\\\\\\\\\\\\"racecar\\\\\\\\\\\\\": [\\\\\\\\\\\\\"level\\\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\\\"did\\\\\\\\\\\\\"], \\\\\\\\\\\\\"level\\\\\\\\\\\\\": [], \\\\\\\\\\\\\"deified\\\\\\\\\\\\\": [], \\\\\\\\\\\\\"deify\\\\\\\\\\\\\": []}\\\\\", \\\\\"assert find_anagrams([\\\\\\\\\\\\\"radar\\\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\\\"kayak\\\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\\\"rotor\\\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\\\"madam\\\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\\\"aman-a\\\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\\\"mom\\\\\\\\\\\\\"]) == {\\\\\\\\\\\\\"radar\\\\\\\\\\\\\": [\\\\\\\\\\\\\"kayak\\\\\\\\\\\\\"], \\\\\\\\\\\\\"kayak\\\\\\\\\\\\\": [\\\\\\\\\\\\\"radar\\\\\\\\\\\\\"], \\\\\\\\\\\\\"rotor\\\\\\\\\\\\\": [], \\\\\\\\\\\\\"madam\\\\\\\\\\\\\": [\\\\\\\\\\\\\"aman-a\\\\\\\\\\\\\"], \\\\\\\\\\\\\"aman-a\\\\\\\\\\\\\": [\\\\\\\\\\\\\"madam\\\\\\\\\\\\\"], \\\\\\\\\\\\\"mom\\\\\\\\\\\\\": []}\\\\\"] }\"'}"
