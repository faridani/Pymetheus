The input operations are as follows:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n- `PUSH X`: Push an element \\'X\\' onto the stack.\\\\\\\\n- `POP`: Pop an element from the stack. If the stack is empty, return False immediately.\\\\\\\\n- `QUERY`: Check if the top of the stack is a \\'B\\'. This will not affect the stack in any way.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWrite a function `is_balanced` that checks if the given sequence of operations results in a balanced stack.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n#### Function Signature\\\\\\\\n```python\\\\\\\\ndef is_balanced(operations: list[str]) -> bool:\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n#### Input\\\\\\\\n- `operations` (list[str]): A list of strings representing the operations.
