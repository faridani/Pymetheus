Your task is to create a new string by interweaving the characters of these two strings. The interwoven string should alternate between characters from `s1` and `s2`, starting with a character from `s1`. If one string is longer than the other, the remaining characters of the longer string should be appended at the end.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n#### Function Signature\\\\\\\\n```python\\\\\\\\ndef interweave_strings(s1: str, s2: str) -> str:\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n#### Input\\\\\\\\n- `s1` (str): The first string.\\\\\\\\n- `s2` (str): The second string.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n#### Output\\\\\\\\n- Returns the interwoven string as described above.\\\\\", \\\\\"code\\\\\": \\\\\"def interweave_strings(s1: str, s2: str) -> str:\\\\\\\\n    interwoven = \\'\\'\\\\\\\\n    i = 0\\\\\\\\n    j = 0\\\\\\\\n    while i < len(s1) or j < len(s2):\\\\\\\\n        if i < len(s1):\\\\\\\\n            interwoven += s1[i]\\\\\\\\n            i += 1\\\\\\\\n        if j < len(s2):\\\\\\\\n            interwoven += s2[j]\\\\\\\\n            j += 1\\\\\\\\n    return interwoven\\\\\", \\\\\"tests\\\\\": [\\\\\"assert interweave_strings(\\'abc\\', \\'def\\') == \\'adbecf\\'\\\\\", \\\\\"assert interweave_strings(\\'hello\\', \\'world\\') == \\'hweolrldlo\\'\\\\\", \\\\\"assert interweave_strings(\\'a\\', \\'bcd\\') == \\'abcd\\'\\\\\", \\\\\"assert interweave_strings(\\'\\', \\'xyz\\') == \\'xyz\\'\\\\\"] }\"'}"
