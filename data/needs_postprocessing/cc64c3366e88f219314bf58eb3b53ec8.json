It can be greater than or equal to the length of the array.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n#### Output\\\\\\\\n- Returns a new list that is the result of rotating the input array by k positions to the right.\\\\\", \\\\\"code\\\\\": \\\\\"import math\\\\\\\\ndef rotate_array(arr: list, k: int) -> list:\\\\\\\\n    n = len(arr)\\\\\\\\n    # Handle k being larger than length of array\\\\\\\\n    k %= n\\\\\\\\n    return arr[-k:] + arr[:-k]\\\\\", \\\\\"tests\\\\\": [\\\\\"assert rotate_array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5], 2) == [4, 5, 1, 2, 3]\\\\\", \\\\\"assert rotate_array([-1, -100, 3, 99], 3) == [2, 3, 99, -1]\\\\\", \\\\\"assert rotate_array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5], 7) == [4, 5, 1, 2, 3]\\\\\"] }\"'}"
