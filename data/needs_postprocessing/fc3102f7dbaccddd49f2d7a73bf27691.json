A word ladder is a sequence of words where each pair of adjacent words differs by exactly one character. For example, if you're given the words 'cat' and 'dog', one possible word ladder could be ['cat', 'bat', 'hog', 'dog']. The input words may contain uppercase letters, lowercase letters, digits, and special characters.
