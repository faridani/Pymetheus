The compressed string should replace consecutive occurrences of the same character with the character followed by the number of times it appears. For example, \\'aaabbcddd\\' would compress to \\'a3b2c1d3\\'. If the compressed string is not shorter than the original, return the original string.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n#### Function Signature\\\\\\\\n```python\\\\\\\\ndef compress(s: str) -> str:\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n#### Input\\\\\\\\n- `s` (str): A string consisting of lowercase letters.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n#### Output\\\\\\\\n- Returns the compressed version of the input string if it\\'s shorter than the original, otherwise returns the original string.\\\\\", \\\\\"code\\\\\": \\\\\"def compress(s: str) -> str:\\\\\\\\n    if not s:\\\\\\\\n        return s\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    compressed = \\'\\'\\\\\\\\n    count = 1\\\\\\\\n    prev_char = s[0]\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    for i in range(1, len(s)):\\\\\\\\n        if s[i] == prev_char:\\\\\\\\n            count += 1\\\\\\\\n        else:\\\\\\\\n            compressed += prev_char + (str(count) if count > 1 else \\'\\')\\\\\\\\n            prev_char = s[i]\\\\\\\\n            count = 1\\\\\\\\n    compressed += prev_char + (str(count) if count > 1 else \\'\\')\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    return compressed if len(compressed) < len(s) else s\\\\\", \\\\\"tests\\\\\": [\\\\\"\\'assert compress(\\'aaabbcddd\\') == \\'a3b2c1d3\\'\\\\\", \\\\\"\\'assert compress(\\'aabbcc\\') == \\'a2b2c2\\'\\\\\", \\\\\"\\'assert compress(\\'abcdefg\\') == \\'abcdefg\\'\\\\\", \\\\\"\\'assert compress(\\'\\') == \\'\\'\\'\\\\\"] }\"'}"
