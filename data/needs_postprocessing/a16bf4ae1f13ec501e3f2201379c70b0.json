"{'model': 'qwen2:7b', 'response': '\"{ \\\\\"title\\\\\": \\\\\"Median of Two Sorted Arrays\\\\\", \\\\\"description\\\\\": \\\\\"You are given two sorted arrays nums1 and nums2. Your task is to find the median value(s) when combining both arrays into one. If the total number of elements is odd, there will be a single median; if it\\'s even, there will be two medians.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n#### Function Signature\\\\\\\\n```python\\\\\\\\ndef find_median(nums1: list[int], nums2: list[int]) -> float or tuple[float]:\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n#### Input\\\\\\\\n- `nums1`: A sorted array of integers.\\\\\\\\n- `nums2`: Another sorted array of integers.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n#### Output\\\\\\\\nReturn the median value(s) as a floating-point number if there is an odd total length, or as a tuple containing two floating-point numbers for even total lengths.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n#### Constraints\\\\\\\\n- Both input arrays are non-empty and consist only of integers ranging from -10^5 to 10^5.\\\\\\\\n- The combined array will contain the elements of both input arrays in sorted order.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n#### Examples\\\\\\\\nassert find_median([1, 3], [2]) == 2.0\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nassert find_median([-1, 0], [4, 5, 6]) == (0.5, 0.5)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nassert find_median([], [-1]) == -1.0\\\\\" }\"'}"
