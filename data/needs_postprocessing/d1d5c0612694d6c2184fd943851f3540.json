Additionally, you will need to sort the letters in each string and compare the sorted strings.\\\\\", \\\\\"code\\\\\": \\\\\"def are_anagrams(s1: str, s2: str) -> bool:\\\\\\\\n    # Remove non-alphabetic characters and convert to lowercase\\\\\\\\n    s1 = \\'\\'.join([char for char in s1.lower() if char.isalpha()])\\\\\\\\n    s2 = \\'\\'.join([char for char in s2.lower() if char.isalpha()])\\\\\\\\n    # If the strings have different lengths, they cannot be anagrams\\\\\\\\n    if len(s1) != len(s2):\\\\\\\\n        return False\\\\\\\\n    # Sort the letters and compare\\\\\\\\n    return sorted(s1) == sorted(s2)\\\\\", \\\\\"tests\\\\\": [\\\\\"assert are_anagrams(\\\\\\\\\\\\\"listen\\\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\\\"silent\\\\\\\\\\\\\") == True\\\\\", \\\\\"assert are_anagrams(\\\\\\\\\\\\\"hello\\\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\\\"world\\\\\\\\\\\\\") == False\\\\\", \\\\\"assert are_anagrams(\\\\\\\\\\\\\"A man, a plan, a canal: Panama\\\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\\\"amanaplanacanalpanama\\\\\\\\\\\\\") == True\\\\\"] }\"'}"
