"{'model': 'mistral:latest', 'response': '\"{ \\\\\"title\\\\\": \\\\\"\\'Is it a Circular Array?\\' (hard)\\\\\", \\\\\"description\\\\\": \\\\\"A circular array means that the rotation of the array does not change its order. For example, if we have an array `[1, 2, 3, 4]` and rotate it by one position to get `[2, 3, 4, 1]`, this is considered a circular rotation of the original array.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWrite a function `is_circular_array(arr: List[int]) -> bool` that checks if the given list of integers forms a circular array.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n#### Function Signature\\\\\\\\n```python\\\\\\\\ndef is_circular_array(arr: List[int]) -> bool:\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n#### Input\\\\\\\\n- `arr` (List[int]): A sorted list of integers.
