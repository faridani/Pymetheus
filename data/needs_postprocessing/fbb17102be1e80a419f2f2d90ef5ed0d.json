In other words, it does not contain any edges that connect a node back to itself. A path in a DAG is a sequence of nodes that are connected by directed edges. The longest path in a DAG is the path that has the maximum number of nodes.\\n\\nWrite a function `longest_path` that takes as input an adjacency list representation of a DAG and returns the length of its longest path.\\n\\n#### Function Signature\\n```python\\ndef longest_path(graph: dict) -> int:\\n```\\n\\n#### Input\\n- `graph` (dict): A dictionary representing the adjacency list of a directed acyclic graph. The keys are node names, and the values are lists of neighboring nodes.\\n\\n#### Output\\n- Returns an integer representing the length of the longest path in the input DAG.\\n\\nNote: Two nodes are connected by an edge if one node is listed in another's value list. For example, if `graph['A'] = ['B', 'C']`, then there are edges from `A` to `B` and from `A` to `C`.\\n\\nFor this problem, you can assume that the input graph does not contain any self-loops (i.e., an edge from a node to itself) or multiple edges between two nodes.\\n\\n#### Tests\\n[\\n    \", \"0\": \"assert longest_path({'A': []}) == 1\", \"assert longest_path({'A': ['B'], 'B': ['C']}) == 3\": \"assert longest_path({'A': ['B', 'C'], 'B': ['D'], 'C': ['E'], 'D': ['F'], 'E': ['F']}) == 5\", \"section\": \"from collections import deque\\n\\ndef longest_path(graph: dict) -> int:\\n    in_degree = {node: 0 for node in graph\"}, [\"neighbor\"], [\"node for node, degree in in_degree.items() if degree == 0\"], [\"current_node\"], [\"neighbor\"], [\"neighbor\"]]"
