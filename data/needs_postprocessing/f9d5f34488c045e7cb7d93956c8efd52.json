"{'model': 'mistral:latest', 'response': '\"{ \\\\\"title\\\\\": \\\\\"\\'Prime Digit Count\\' (Medium)\\\\\", \\\\\"description\\\\\": \\\\\"Write a function `prime_digit_count` that takes an integer `n` as input and returns the count of prime digits present in `n`. Note that a digit is considered to be prime only if it is less than 10. For example, the digit \\'2\\' is not prime while \\'3\\', \\'5\\', \\'7\\' are.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n#### Function Signature\\\\\\\\n```python\\\\\\\\ndef prime_digit_count(n: int) -> int:\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n#### Input\\\\\\\\n- `n` (int): A non-negative integer.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n#### Output\\\\\\\\n- Returns the count of prime digits present in the input integer.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n#### Hints\\\\\\\\n1. Use a helper function to check if a number is prime. You can find the implementation for this helper function easily online or in our previous problems on Project Euler.\\\\\", \\\\\"code\\\\\": \\\\\"def is_prime(num):\\\\\\\\n    if num < 2:\\\\\\\\n        return False\\\\\\\\n    for i in range(2, int(num**0.5)+1):\\\\\\\\n        if num % i == 0:\\\\\\\\n            return False\\\\\\\\n    return True\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\ndef prime_digit_count(n: int) -> int:\\\\\\\\n    str_n = str(n)\\\\\\\\n    count = 0\\\\\\\\n    for digit in str_n:\\\\\\\\n        if is_prime(int(digit)):\\\\\\\\n            count += 1\\\\\\\\n    return count\\\\\", \\\\\"tests\\\\\": [\\\\\"assert prime_digit_count(371) == 3\\\\\", \\\\\"assert prime_digit_count(3) == 1\\\\\", \\\\\"assert prime_digit_count(9683) == 2\\\\\", \\\\\"assert prime_digit_count(494) == 0\\\\\"] }\"'}"
