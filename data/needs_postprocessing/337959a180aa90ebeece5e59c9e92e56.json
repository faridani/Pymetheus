"{'model': 'phi3:14b', 'response': '{\"title\": \"Medium Python Coding Question: String Compression\", \"description\": \"String compression involves shortening a string by using the counts of repeated characters. If a character appears more than once consecutively, it should be followed by the count of occurrences (e.g., \\'aabbbc\\' compresses to \\'a2b3c\\'). However, if the compressed string is not shorter than the original string or equal in length but takes up more space due to numeric representation, return the original string instead.\\\\n\\\\n#### Function Signature\\\\n```python\\\\ndef string_compression(s: str) -> str:\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\n#### Input\\\\n- `s` (str): A non-empty string consisting of only lowercase letters \\'a\\'-\\'z\\'.
