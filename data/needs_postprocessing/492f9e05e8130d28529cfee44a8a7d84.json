The problem is not about computing the product of the matrices but finding out how to arrange the multiplications so that the total number of simple scalar multiplications needed for the matrix chain product is minimized.\\\\n\\\\n#### Function Signature\\\\n```python\\\\ndef matrix_chain_order(p: list) -> int:\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\n#### Input\\\\n- `p` (list): A list of dimensions. For example, a matrix `A[i][j]` has dimension `p[i-1] x p[i]`. The first matrix `A1` is always `p[0] x p[1]`. So the total number of matrices is `len(p) - 1`. \\\\n\\\\n#### Output\\\\n- Returns an integer representing the minimum number of multiplications needed to multiply the chain.\\\\n\\\", \\\"code\\\": \\\"def matrix_chain_order(p: list) -> int:\\\\n    n = len(p)\\\\n\\\\n    # Table to store results of subproblems\\\\n    m = [[0 for x in range(n)] for x in range(n)]\\\\n\\\\n    # Chain length is 2\\\\n    for i in range(1, n):\\\\n        m[i][i] = 0\\\\n\\\\n    # Chain length greater than 2\\\\n    for L in range(2, n):\\\\n        for i in range(1, n - L + 1):\\\\n            j = i + L - 1\\\\n            m[i][j] = float('inf')\\\\n\\\\n            for k in range(i, j):\\\\n                # q is cost/scalar multiplications\\\\n                q = m[i][k] + m[k+1][j] + p[i-1]*p[k]*p[j]\\\\n                if q < m[i][j]:\\\\n                    m[i][j] = q\\\\n\\\\n    return m[1][n-1]\\\\n\\\", \\\"tests\\\": [\\\"assert matrix_chain_order([1, 2, 3, 4]) == 18\\\", \\\"assert matrix_chain_order([5, 10, 3, 12, 5, 50, 6]) == 2010\\\"] }\""
