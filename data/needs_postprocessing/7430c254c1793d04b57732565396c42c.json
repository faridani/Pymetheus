"{'model': 'mistral:latest', 'response': '\"{ \\\\\"title\\\\\": \\\\\"Polindromes with Repeated Characters (Medium)\\\\\", \\\\\"description\\\\\": \\\\\"A polindrome is a word, phrase, number, or other sequence of characters that reads the same forward and backward (ignoring spaces, punctuation, and capitalization). However, in this problem, we allow repetition of characters in the polindrome. Write a function `is_polindrome` that checks if a given string is a polindrome.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n#### Function Signature\\\\\\\\n```python\\\\\\\\ndef is_polindrome(s: str) -> bool:\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n#### Input\\\\\\\\n- `s` (str): A string that may contain letters, numbers, spaces, and punctuation.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n#### Output\\\\\\\\n- Returns `True` if the input string is a polindrome, `False` otherwise.
