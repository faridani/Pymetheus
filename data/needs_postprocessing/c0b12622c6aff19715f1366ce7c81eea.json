"{'model': 'gemma2:27b', 'response': '\"{ \\\\\"title\\\\\": \\\\\"Hard: Alien Language Translator\\\\\", \\\\\"description\\\\\": \\\\\"You\\'ve intercepted a message from an alien civilization. The message consists of a series of integers separated by spaces. You believe these integers represent words, but you don\\'t know the mapping between integers and words.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nYour task is to write a function `translate_alien_message` that takes a string representing the alien message as input and returns a list of possible translations. Each translation should be a list of strings (representing the words in the message).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAssume the following:\\\\\\\\n* The alien language has a vocabulary of up to 10 unique words.\\\\\\\\n* Each word is represented by a single integer between 1 and 10.\\\\\\\\n* The order of words in the message matters.\\\\\\\\n* There may be multiple valid translations for a given message.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n#### Function Signature\\\\\\\\n```python\\\\\\\\ndef translate_alien_message(message: str) -> list[list[str]]:\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n#### Input\\\\\\\\n- `message` (str): A string representing the alien message, with integers separated by spaces. Example: \\\\\\\\\\\\\"1 2 3 1 4\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n#### Output\\\\\\\\n- Returns a list of lists, where each inner list represents a possible translation of the message. Each word in the translation should be a string. For example:\\\\\\\\n```python\\\\\\\\n[[\\\\\\\\\\\\\"word1\\\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\\\"word2\\\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\\\"word3\\\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\\\"word1\\\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\\\"word4\\\\\\\\\\\\\"],\\\\\\\\n[\\\\\\\\\\\\\"another_word1\\\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\\\"another_word2\\\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\\\"another_word3\\\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\\\"another_word1\\\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\\\"another_word4\\\\\\\\\\\\\"]]\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\", \\\\\"code\\\\\": \\\\\"def translate_alien_message(message: str) -> list[list[str]]:\\\\\\\\n    possible_translations = []\\\\\\\\n    words = message.split()\\\\\\\\n    vocabulary = {i: \\'\\' for i in range(1, 11)}\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    def backtrack(index: int, current_translation: list[str]):\\\\\\\\n        if index == len(words):\\\\\\\\n            possible_translations.append(current_translation)\\\\\\\\n            return\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n        word = words[index]\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n        for word_meaning in [\\'word\\' + str(i) for i in range(1, 11)]:\\\\\\\\n            vocabulary[int(word)] = word_meaning\\\\\\\\n            backtrack(index + 1, current_translation + [word_meaning])\\\\\\\\n    \\\\\\\\n    backtrack(0, [])\\\\\\\\n    return possible_translations\\\\\\\\n\\\\\", \\\\\"tests\\\\\": [\\\\\"assert translate_alien_message(\\'1 2 3 1 4\\') == [[\\'word1\\', \\'word2\\', \\'word3\\', \\'word1\\', \\'word4\\'], [\\'another_word1\\', \\'another_word2\\', \\'another_word3\\', \\'another_word1\\', \\'another_word4\\']]\\\\\"] }\"'}"
