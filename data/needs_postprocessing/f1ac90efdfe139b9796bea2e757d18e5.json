The spiral is constructed by starting with 1, then moving to the right and down until hitting a previously visited number, then going up and left until reaching a new number and continuing this pattern. If there are multiple paths at the same point, choose the path with the smaller diagonal index (diagonal distance from the start). \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n#### Function Signature\\\\\\\\n```python\\\\\\\\ndef sum_of_diagonal_numbers(n: int) -> int:\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n#### Input\\\\\\\\n- `n` (int): The nth diagonal number to sum.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n#### Output\\\\\\\\n- Returns the sum of the numbers on the nth diagonal as an integer.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\", \\\\\"code\\\\\": \\\\\"def is_valid(x, y, grid, visited):\\\\\\\\n    return x >= 0 and y >= 0 and (x < len(grid) and y < len(grid[0])) and not visited[(x, y)]\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\ndef sum_of_diagonal_numbers(n: int) -> int:\\\\\\\\n    grid = [[0] * n for _ in range(n)]\\\\\\\\n    direction = 1\\\\\\\\n    x, y = 0, 0\\\\\\\\n    total = 0\\\\\\\\n    visited = set()\\\\\\\\n    while len(visited) < n**2:\\\\\\\\n        num = total + direction\\\\\\\\n        grid[x][y] = num\\\\\\\\n        visited.add((x, y))\\\\\\\\n        next_x, next_y = x + direction, y + (direction + 1) // 2\\\\\\\\n        if not is_valid(next_x, next_y, grid, visited):\\\\\\\\n            direction = -direction\\\\\\\\n            next_x, next_y = x - direction, y + (direction + 1) // 2\\\\\\\\n        x, y = next_x, next_y\\\\\\\\n        total += 1\\\\\\\\n    diagonal = len(grid) - 1\\\\\\\\n    return grid[diagonal][diagonal] + sum([grid[i][i] for i in range(len(grid)) if i != diagonal])\\\\\\\\n\\\\\", \\\\\"tests\\\\\": [\\\\\"assert sum_of_diagonal_numbers(1) == 1\\\\\", \\\\\"assert sum_of_diagonal_numbers(3) == 10\\\\\", \\\\\"assert sum_of_diagonal_numbers(5) == 26\\\\\", \\\\\"assert sum_of_diagonal_numbers(10) == 64\\\\\"] }\"'}"
