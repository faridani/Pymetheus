"{'model': 'mistral:latest', 'response': '\"{ \\\\\"title\\\\\": \\\\\"\\\\\\\\\\\\\"The Anagram Palindrome Problem\\\\\\\\\\\\\" (hard)\\\\\", \\\\\"description\\\\\": \\\\\"An anagram of a word or phrase is a rearrangement of its letters.

A palindrome is a word, phrase, number, or other sequence of characters that reads the same forward and backward (ignoring spaces, punctuation, and capitalization).
