A circular array can be imagined as an array where the last element is connected to the first element. Your task is to determine the minimum number of rotations required to sort the array in ascending order.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n#### Function Signature\\\\\\\\n```python\\\\\\\\ndef min_rotations(arr: list[int]) -> int:\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n#### Input\\\\\\\\n- `arr` (list[int]): A list of integers representing the circular array.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n#### Output\\\\\\\\n- Returns the minimum number of rotations required to sort the array in ascending order.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Constraints**:\\\\\\\\n1 <= len(arr) <= 10^5\\\\\\\\n-10^9 <= arr[i] <= 10^9\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Example:**\\\\\\\\nFor `arr = [4, 5, 6, 7, 0, 1, 2]`, the minimum rotations required is 4. \\\\\\\\nAfter 4 rotations: `[0, 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7]`\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Hint:** Think about finding a point in the array where the elements start to decrease.\\\\\", \\\\\"code\\\\\": \\\\\"def min_rotations(arr: list[int]) -> int:\\\\\\\\n    n = len(arr)\\\\\\\\n    min_index = 0\\\\\\\\n    for i in range(1, n):\\\\\\\\n        if arr[i] < arr[min_index]:\\\\\\\\n            min_index = i\\\\\\\\n    return min_index\\\\\\\\n\\\\\", \\\\\"tests\\\\\": [\\\\\"assert min_rotations([4, 5, 6, 7, 0, 1, 2]) == 4\\\\\", \\\\\"assert min_rotations([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]) == 0\\\\\", \\\\\"assert min_rotations([5, 4, 3, 2, 1]) == 4\\\\\"] }\"'}"
