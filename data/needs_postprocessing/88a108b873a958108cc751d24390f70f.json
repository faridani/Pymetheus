They\\'ve brought with them a mysterious message written in their own alphabet. You, as the lead cryptographer, are tasked with deciphering this message.\\\\n\\\\nFortunately, you\\'ve intercepted some intel: The aliens\\' alphabet consists of unique characters represented by integers from 0 to 25 (inclusive). Their language follows simple rules:\\\\n\\\\n- Each word is separated by a single space (integer \\'26\\').\\\\n- A double space (integer \\'27\\') indicates the end of a sentence.\\\\n\\\\nYou are given a string `alien_message` containing integers representing the alien message. Write a function `decode_message` to translate this numerical message into English words.\\\\n\\\\n#### Function Signature\\\\n```python\\\\ndef decode_message(alien_message: list[int]) -> str:\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\n#### Input\\\\n- `alien_message` (list[int]): A list of integers representing the alien message.
