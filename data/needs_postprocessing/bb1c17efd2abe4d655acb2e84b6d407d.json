You can perform three types of edit operations:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n- **Insertion:** Insert a character into `s`.\\\\\\\\n- **Deletion:** Delete a character from `s`.\\\\\\\\n- **Substitution:** Replace a character in `s` with another character.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nHowever, there\\'s an additional constraint:  \\\\\\\\n* You cannot insert the same character consecutively more than twice. For example, if you insert \\'a\\' once, you can insert it again, but not for a third consecutive time.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n#### Function Signature\\\\\\\\n```python\\\\\\\\ndef min_edit_distance(s: str, t: str) -> int:\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n#### Input\\\\\\\\n- `s` (str): The source string.\\\\\\\\n- `t` (str): The target string.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n#### Output\\\\\\\\n- Returns the minimum edit distance between `s` and `t`, considering the insertion constraint.\\\\\", \\\\\"code\\\\\": \\\\\"def min_edit_distance(s: str, t: str) -> int:\\\\\\\\n    n = len(s)\\\\\\\\n    m = len(t)\\\\\\\\n    dp = [[float(\\'inf\\')] * (m + 1) for _ in range(n + 1)]\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    # Base cases\\\\\\\\n    for i in range(n + 1):\\\\\\\\n        dp[i][0] = i\\\\\\\\n    for j in range(m + 1):\\\\\\\\n        dp[0][j] = j\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    # Fill the DP table\\\\\\\\n    for i in range(1, n + 1):\\\\\\\\n        for j in range(1, m + 1):\\\\\\\\n            if s[i - 1] == t[j - 1]:\\\\\\\\n                dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j - 1]\\\\\\\\n            else:\\\\\\\\n                dp[i][j] = min(\\\\\\\\n                    dp[i - 1][j] + 1,  # Deletion\\\\\\\\n                    dp[i][j - 1] + 1,  # Insertion\\\\\\\\n                    dp[i - 1][j - 1] + 1  # Substitution\\\\\\\\n                )\\\\\\\\n    return dp[n][m]\\\\\\\\n\\\\\", \\\\\"tests\\\\\": [\\\\\"\\'assert min_edit_distance(\\\\\\\\\\\\\"kitten\\\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\\\"sitting\\\\\\\\\\\\\") == 3\\'\\\\\", \\\\\"\\'assert min_edit_distance(\\\\\\\\\\\\\"intention\\\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\\\"execution\\\\\\\\\\\\\") == 5\\'\\\\\", \\\\\"\\'assert min_edit_distance(\\\\\\\\\\\\\"aaa\\\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\\\"aa\\\\\\\\\\\\\") == 1\\'\\\\\", \\\\\"\\'assert min_edit_distance(\\\\\\\\\\\\\"abcd\\\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\\\"abcde\\\\\\\\\\\\\") == 1\\'\\\\\"] }\"'}"
