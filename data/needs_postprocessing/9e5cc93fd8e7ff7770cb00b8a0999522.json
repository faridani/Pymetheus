Write a function `is_perfect_square_sum` that determines if the given number can be expressed as the sum of one or more consecutive perfect squares. For example, 13 can be represented as 4 + 9 (2^2 + 3^2), hence it\\'s a perfect square sum.\\\\\", \\\\\"function_signature\\\\\": \\\\\"```python\\\\\\\\ndef is_perfect_square_sum(n: int) -> bool:\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n#### Input\\\\\\\\n- `n` (int): A non-negative integer.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n#### Output\\\\\\\\n- Returns `True` if the input number can be expressed as the sum of one or more consecutive perfect squares, `False` otherwise.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\", \\\\\"code\\\\\": \\\\\"import math\\\\\\\\ndef is_perfect_square_sum(n: int) -> bool:\\\\\\\\n    if n < 1:\\\\\\\\n        return False\\\\\\\\n    i = 0\\\\\\\\n    total = 0\\\\\\\\n    while total < n:\\\\\\\\n        i += 1\\\\\\\\n        total += i**2\\\\\\\\n        if total == n:\\\\\\\\n            return True\\\\\\\\n    return False\\\\\", \\\\\"tests\\\\\": [\\\\\"assert is_perfect_square_sum(5) == False\\\\\", \\\\\"assert is_perfect_square_sum(13) == True\\\\\", \\\\\"assert is_perfect_square_sum(24) == True\\\\\", \\\\\"assert is_perfect_square_sum(29) == False\\\\\", \\\\\"assert is_perfect_square_sum(65) == True\\\\\"] }\"'}"
