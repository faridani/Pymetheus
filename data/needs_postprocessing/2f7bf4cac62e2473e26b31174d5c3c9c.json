"{'model': 'mistral:latest', 'response': '\"{ \\\\\"title\\\\\": \\\\\"\\'Palindromic Anagram Checker (Medium)\\'\\\\\", \\\\\"description\\\\\": \\\\\"An anagram is a word or phrase formed by rearranging the letters of a different word or phrase, typically using all the original letters exactly once. A palindrome is a word, phrase, number, or other sequence of characters that reads the same forward and backward (ignoring spaces, punctuation, and capitalization). In this problem, you are given two strings \\'s1\\' and \\'s2\\'. Your task is to check if they are anagrams of each other and also palindromes.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n#### Function Signature\\\\\\\\n```python\\\\\\\\ndef is_palindrome_anagram(s1: str, s2: str) -> bool:\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n#### Input\\\\\\\\n- `s1` (str): A string that may contain letters, numbers, spaces, and punctuation.\\\\\\\\n- `s2` (str): Another string of the same type as \\'s1\\'.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n#### Output\\\\\\\\n- Returns `True` if both strings are palindromes and anagrams of each other, `False` otherwise.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\", \\\\\"code\\\\\": \\\\\"import collections\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\ndef is_palindrome_anagram(s1: str, s2: str) -> bool:\\\\\\\\n    # Remove non-alphanumeric characters\\\\\\\\n    s1 = \\'\\'.join(char for char in s1 if char.isalnum())\\\\\\\\n    s2 = \\'\\'.join(char for char in s2 if char.isalnum())\\\\\\\\n    # Check if the strings are anagrams of each other\\\\\\\\n    if len(s1) != len(s2):\\\\\\\\n        return False\\\\\\\\n    freq_map = collections.Counter(s1)\\\\\\\\n    for key, value in freq_map.items():\\\\\\\\n        if freq_map[key] != s2.count(key):\\\\\\\\n            return False\\\\\\\\n    # Check if the strings are palindromes\\\\\\\\n    return s1 == s1[::-1] and s2 == s2[::-1]\\\\\\\\n\\\\\", \\\\\"tests\\\\\": [\\\\\"assert is_palindrome_anagram(\\'A man, a plan, a canal, Panama\\', \\'amanaplanacanalpanam\\') == True\\\\\", \\\\\"assert is_palindrome_anagram(\\'racecar\\', \\'racercar\\') == True\\\\\", \\\\\"assert is_palindrome_anagram(\\'hello\\', \\'olleh\\') == False\\\\\", \\\\\"assert is_palindrome_anagram(\\'No \\\\\\\\\\'x\\\\\\\\\\' in Nixon\\', \\'xix x-X x+o n+i n-X x+x\\') == True\\\\\"] }\"'}"
