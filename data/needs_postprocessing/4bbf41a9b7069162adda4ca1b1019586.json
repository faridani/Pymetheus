"{'model': 'gemma2:27b', 'response': '\"{ \\\\\"title\\\\\": \\\\\"Hard: Alien Language Translator\\\\\", \\\\\"description\\\\\": \\\\\"You\\'ve intercepted a series of messages from an unknown alien civilization.  These messages consist solely of sequences of prime numbers. Your task is to write a function `translate` that takes a list of prime numbers as input and attempts to decode the message based on the following assumptions:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n- **Frequency Analysis:** The most frequent prime number in the sequence likely represents a common word, such as \\'the\\' or \\'a\\'.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n- **Positional Significance:**  The position of prime numbers within the sequence might hold meaning. For example, the first prime number could indicate a subject, the second an action, and so on. \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n#### Function Signature\\\\\\\\n```python\\\\\\\\ndef translate(primes: list[int]) -> str:\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n#### Input\\\\\\\\n- `primes` (list[int]): A list of prime numbers representing the alien message.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n#### Output\\\\\\\\n- Returns a string containing the translated message. If no meaningful translation can be determined, return \\\\\\\\\\\\\"Message Untranslatable\\\\\\\\\\\\\".\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Hint:** Consider using libraries like `collections.Counter` for frequency analysis and explore different positional mapping schemes.\\\\\", \\\\\"code\\\\\": \\\\\"from collections import Counter\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\ndef translate(primes: list[int]) -> str:\\\\\\\\n    prime_counts = Counter(primes)\\\\\\\\n    most_common_prime = prime_counts.most_common(1)[0][0]\\\\\\\\n    # Very basic translation example, you\\'ll need to expand this logic\\\\\\\\n    if most_common_prime == 2: \\\\\\\\n        return \\\\\\\\\\\\\"The message likely contains the word \\'the\\'\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n    else:\\\\\\\\n        return \\\\\\\\\\\\\"Message Untranslatable\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n\\\\\", \\\\\"tests\\\\\": [\\\\\"\\'assert translate([2, 3, 5, 2, 7, 2]) == \\\\\\\\\\\\\"The message likely contains the word \\'the\\'\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\"] }\"'}"
