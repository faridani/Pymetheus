The aliens communicate using a unique language where words are formed by combining prime numbers.  \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n#### Function Signature \\\\\\\\n```python\\\\\\\\ndef decode_message(message: str) -> str:\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n#### Input\\\\\\\\n- `message` (str): A string representing the encoded alien message, consisting of space-separated integers.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n#### Output\\\\\\\\n- Returns a decoded string containing the original alien message. If the input contains non-prime numbers or invalid formatting, return \\\\\\\\\\\\\"Invalid Message\\\\\\\\\\\\\".\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n#### Constraints\\\\\\\\n- The message will contain only positive integers.\\\\\\\\n- Prime numbers are defined as natural numbers greater than 1 that are not products of two smaller natural numbers.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n#### Hints\\\\\\\\n- You\\'ll need to determine which numbers in the input string are prime numbers.\\\\\\\\n- Consider using a dictionary or mapping to associate prime numbers with letters.\\\\\", \\\\\"code\\\\\": \\\\\"def decode_message(message: str) -> str:\\\\\\\\n    primes = {2: \\'a\\', 3: \\'b\\', 5: \\'c\\', 7: \\'d\\', 11: \\'e\\', 13: \\'f\\', 17: \\'g\\', 19: \\'h\\', 23: \\'i\\', 29: \\'j\\', 31: \\'k\\',\\\\\\\\n             37: \\'l\\', 41: \\'m\\', 43: \\'n\\', 47: \\'o\\', 53: \\'p\\', 59: \\'q\\', 61: \\'r\\', 67: \\'s\\', 71: \\'t\\', 73: \\'u\\',\\\\\\\\n             79: \\'v\\', 83: \\'w\\', 89: \\'x\\', 97: \\'y\\', 101: \\'z\\'}\\\\\\\\n    decoded_message = \\'\\'\\\\\\\\n    numbers = message.split()\\\\\\\\n    for number in numbers:\\\\\\\\n        if not number.isdigit():\\\\\\\\n            return \\\\\\\\\\\\\"Invalid Message\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n        num = int(number)\\\\\\\\n        if num in primes:\\\\\\\\n            decoded_message += primes[num]\\\\\\\\n        else:\\\\\\\\n            return \\\\\\\\\\\\\"Invalid Message\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n    return decoded_message\\\\\", \\\\\"tests\\\\\": [\\\\\"assert decode_message(\\\\\\\\\\\\\"2 3 5 7\\\\\\\\\\\\\") == \\\\\\\\\\\\\"abcd\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\", \\\\\"assert decode_message(\\\\\\\\\\\\\"11 13 17\\\\\\\\\\\\\") == \\\\\\\\\\\\\"efg\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\", \\\\\"assert decode_message(\\\\\\\\\\\\\"2 4 6 8\\\\\\\\\\\\\") == \\\\\\\\\\\\\"Invalid Message\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\", \\\\\"assert decode_message(\\\\\\\\\\\\\"2 3 59 73\\\\\\\\\\\\\") == \\\\\\\\\\\\\"abkq\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\", \\\\\"assert decode_message(\\\\\\\\\\\\\"101 3 2\\\\\\\\\\\\\") == \\\\\\\\\\\\\"zayb\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\"] }\"'}"
