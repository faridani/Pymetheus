The pattern consists of three parts separated by `@`:\\r\\n1. The first part is the username, which can contain alphanumeric characters (`a-zA-Z0-9`), dots, underscores and hyphens (`._%+-`).\\r\\n2. The domain name, which must end with a valid top-level domain (`.com`, `.org`, etc.) and cannot have consecutive dots.\\r\\n3. The TLD (top-level domain), which can contain only letters (`a-zA-Z`) and has a minimum length of 2 characters.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe function checks if the email string matches this pattern using `re.match` and returns `True` or `False`, depending on whether it matches the pattern or not. Note that there may be more advanced validation rules, such as checking if the domain actually exists, but they are beyond the scope of this question.\\r\\n\\r\\nExample usage:\\r\\n```python\\r\\nprint(validate_email(\\\"john.doe@example.com\\\"))  # Output: True\\r\\nprint(validate_email(\\\"jane_doe@exampl-example.com\\\"))  # Output: False (underscore not allowed)\\r\\nprint(validate_email(\\\"invalid_email@\\\"))  # Output: False (missing username)\"]]"
