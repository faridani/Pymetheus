Write a function `isValidStack` that takes a list of integers as input and checks if the list represents a valid stack of plates.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n#### Function Signature\\\\\\\\n```python\\\\\\\\ndef isValidStack(stack: List[int]) -> bool:\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n#### Input\\\\\\\\n- `stack` (List[int]): A non-empty list of positive integers representing the number of plates in each stack.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n#### Output\\\\\\\\n- Returns `True` if the input list represents a valid stack of plates, `False` otherwise.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nA valid stack of plates must follow these rules:\\\\\\\\n- The number of plates in the stack is finite and positive (greater than 0).\\\\\\\\n- Each plate must have a diameter greater than or equal to the one below it in the stack. In other words, for two consecutive integers `i` and `i+1`, we have `stack[i] >= stack[i+1]`.\\\\\", \\\\\"code\\\\\": \\\\\"def isValidStack(stack: List[int]) -> bool:\\\\\\\\n    # Loop through the list\\\\\\\\n    for i in range(1, len(stack)):\\\\\\\\n        # If the current plate\\'s diameter is smaller than the previous one, return False\\\\\\\\n        if stack[i] < stack[i-1]:\\\\\\\\n            return False\\\\\\\\n    # If we looped through the entire list without finding any invalid stacks, return True\\\\\\\\n    return True\\\\\", \\\\\"tests\\\\\": [\\\\\"assert isValidStack([5, 3, 4, 2]) == True\\\\\", \\\\\"assert isValidStack([5, 1, 9]) == False\\\\\", \\\\\"assert isValidStack([6, 3, 7, 8]) == False\\\\\"] }\"'}"
