The function should take an 9x9 matrix of integers as its argument.\\\\n\\\\nThe matrix will contain some empty cells represented by zeros, while other cells may contain values from 1 to 9.\\\\n\\\\n#### Function Signature\\\\n```python\\\\ndef solve_sudoku(grid: list[list[int]]) -> list[list[int]]:\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\n#### Input\\\\n- `grid` (list of lists): A 9x9 matrix of integers representing the Sudoku grid. The grid may contain some empty cells represented by zeros, while other cells may contain values from 1 to 9.\\\\n\\\\n#### Output\\\\n- Returns the solved Sudoku grid as a list of lists.
