The next greater element of an element is the first element that appears after it, and is greater than it.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n#### Function Signature\\\\\\\\n```python\\\\\\\\ndef next_greater_element(nums: List[int]) -> List[int]:\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n#### Input\\\\\\\\n- `nums` (List[int]): A circular array of size `n`. The elements in the list are unique and no element appears more than once.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n#### Output\\\\\\\\n- Returns a list, where each index corresponds to an element in the input array, and the value at that index is the next greater element for that particular element. If there is no next greater element, return `-1`.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\", \\\\\"code\\\\\": \\\\\"from typing import List\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\ndef next_greater_element(nums: List[int]) -> List[int]:\\\\\\\\n    # Create a dictionary to store the indices of each element in the array\\\\\\\\n    ind = {num: i for i, num in enumerate(nums)}\\\\\\\\n    # Initialize an empty list to store the next greater elements\\\\\\\\n    nge = []\\\\\\\\n    # Iterate through the numbers in the array\\\\\\\\n    for num in nums:\\\\\\\\n        # If the current number is the largest in the array (i.e., no larger number exists), append -1 to the list and continue\\\\\\\\n        if not nums[ind[num + 1] if ind[num + 1] else len(nums)] > num:\\\\\\\\n            nge.append(-1)\\\\\\\\n            continue\\\\\\\\n        # Append the index of the next greater element to the list\\\\\\\\n        nge.append(ind[num + 1] if ind[num + 1] else len(nums))\\\\\\\\n    \\\\\\\\n    # Return the list of next greater elements\\\\\\\\n    return nge\\\\\", \\\\\"tests\\\\\": [\\\\\"assert next_greater_element([2, 3, 4, -1]) == [3, 4, -1, -1]\\\\\\\\n\\\\\", \\\\\"assert next_greater_element([5, 4, 3, 2]) == [-1, 5, -1, -1]\\\\\\\\n\\\\\", \\\\\"assert next_greater_element([0, 1, 2, 3]) == [1, 2, 3, -1]\\\\\\\\n\\\\\"] }\"'}"
