The characters in `s2` must appear in the same order as they do in `s2`.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n#### Function Signature\\\\\\\\n```python\\\\\\\\ndef min_window_substring(s1: str, s2: str) -> str:\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n#### Input\\\\\\\\n- `s1` (str): A string that may contain any character.\\\\\\\\n- `s2` (str): A string containing characters that must appear in the minimum window substring of `s1`.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n#### Output\\\\\\\\n- Returns a string representing the minimum window substring of `s1` that contains all characters of `s2`. If no such substring exists, return an empty string.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nNote: You can assume that both strings are not null and have length at least 1.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\", \\\\\"code\\\\\": \\\\\"from collections import defaultdict\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\ndef min_window_substring(s1: str, s2: str) -> str:\\\\\\\\n    if len(s2) > len(s1):\\\\\\\\n        return \\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n    # Create a dictionary to store the frequency of characters in s2\\\\\\\\n    freq = defaultdict(int)\\\\\\\\n    for char in s2:\\\\\\\\n        freq[char] += 1\\\\\\\\n    # Initialize variables to keep track of the minimum window substring\\\\\\\\n    min_window = \\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n    min_len = float(\\'inf\\')\\\\\\\\n    # Initialize variables to keep track of the current window substring\\\\\\\\n    left = 0\\\\\\\\n    formed_chars = 0\\\\\\\\n    # Iterate over s1 to find the minimum window substring\\\\\\\\n    for right in range(len(s1)):\\\\\\\\n        if s1[right] in freq:\\\\\\\\n            # If the character is in s2, increment its frequency and update the number of formed characters\\\\\\\\n            freq[s1[right]] += 1\\\\\\\\n            if freq[s1[right]] <= freq[char]:\\\\\\\\n                formed_chars += 1\\\\\\\\n        while left <= right and formed_chars == len(s2):\\\\\\\\n            # If all characters of s2 are formed, update the minimum window substring if necessary\\\\\\\\n            if right - left + 1 < min_len:\\\\\\\\n                min_window = s1[left:right+1]\\\\\\\\n                min_len = right - left + 1\\\\\\\\n            # If the character at the left pointer is in s2, decrement its frequency and remove it from formed_chars\\\\\\\\n            if s1[left] in freq:\\\\\\\\n                freq[s1[left]] -= 1\\\\\\\\n                if freq[s1[left]] < freq[char]:\\\\\\\\n                    formed_chars -= 1\\\\\\\\n            # Move the left pointer to the right\\\\\\\\n            left += 1\\\\\\\\n    return min_window\\\\\", \\\\\"tests\\\\\": [\\\\\"assert min_window_substring(\\\\\\\\\\\\\"abcabdcadbcdeefcccbcad\\\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\\\"abc\\\\\\\\\\\\\") == \\\\\\\\\\\\\"abc\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\", \\\\\"assert min_window_substring(\\\\\\\\\\\\\"abcdedcda\\\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\\\"dc\\\\\\\\\\\\\") == \\\\\\\\\\\\\"dc\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\", \\\\\"assert min_window_substring(\\\\\\\\\\\\\"aabbcdcd\\\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\\\"bb\\\\\\\\\\\\\") == \\\\\\\\\\\\\"bb\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\", \\\\\"assert min_window_substring(\\\\\\\\\\\\\"abcd\\\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\\\"def\\\\\\\\\\\\\") == \\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\"] }\"'}"
