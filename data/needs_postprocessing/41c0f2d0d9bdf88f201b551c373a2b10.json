Radix sort works by sorting numbers based on individual digits, starting from the rightmost digit and moving leftwards.\\\\n\\\\n#### Function Signature\\\\n```python\\\\ndef radix_sort(arr: List[int]) -> List[int]:\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\n#### Input\\\\n- `arr` (List[int]): A sorted list of positive integers with a maximum number of digits `k`. The input can contain leading zeros.\\\\n\\\\n#### Output\\\\n- Returns a new sorted list of integers in ascending order.\\\\n\\\\n**Hint:** Radix sort uses LSB first, and for each pass, counts from 0 to 9 and sorts the array based on the corresponding digit (1\\'s place, 10\\'s place, 100\\'s place etc.). The number of passes is equal to the maximum number of digits in any integer. You may find the `len()` function useful for determining this value.\\\\n\\',\\\\n    \\\\\"code\\\\\": \\\\\"def radix_sort(arr: List[int]) -> List[int]:\\\\n    # Determine the maximum number of digits (k)\\\\n    k = len(str(max(arr))) + 1\\\\n\\\\n    # Create an empty array of buckets for each digit from 0 to 9\\\\n    buckets = [[[] for _ in range(10)] for _ in range(k)]\\\\n\\\\n    # Iterate over each pass (digit)\\\\n    for i in range(k):\\\\n        # Count the number of occurrences of each digit in the current digit position and place them in their respective buckets\\\\n        for num in arr:\\\\n            bucket_num = (num // 10**i) % 10\\\\n            buckets[i][bucket_num].append(num)\\\\n\\\\n        # Reconstruct the array by concatenating the sorted lists from each bucket and appending to a result list\\\\n        arr = []\\\\n        for j in range(10):\\\\n            arr.extend(sorted(buckets[i][j]))\\\\n    \\\\n    return arr\\\\\",\\\\n    \\\\\"tests\\\\\": [\\'assert radix_sort([3849, 2985, 9767, 145, 24]) == [145, 24, 2985, 3849, 9767]\\', \\'assert radix_sort([12, 100, 101, 123, 1001, 1234]) == [12, 100, 101, 123, 1001, 1234]\\', \\'assert radix_sort([999, 123, 567, 888, 456, 777]) == [456, 567, 777, 888, 999, 123]\\']\"}'}"
