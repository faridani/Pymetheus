It can also be used as a simple model for the growth of certain types of curves. The equation of the spiral is given by `r = theta / (2 * pi)` where `r` is the radius of the circle, `theta` is the angle from the center of the circle in radians, and `pi` is a mathematical constant approximately equal to 3.14.
