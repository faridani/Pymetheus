"{'model': 'llama3:latest', 'response': '{\"title\": \"Elegant Spiral\", \"description\": \"The golden ratio (approximately 1.618) has many fascinating properties. One of them is the existence of a spiral with unique proportions, known as the elegant spiral or logarithmic spiral. This spiral can be constructed by starting at the center and moving in a curve that gets closer to the center as you move outward. The distance from the center to the point on the spiral is proportional to the angle around the center.\\\\n\\\\nWrite a function `elegant_spiral` that takes two integers, `start` and `end`, representing the start and end points of the spiral, and returns a string representation of the spiral in the format: \\' \\' (space) for each point on the spiral.\\\\n\\\\n#### Function Signature\\\\n```python\\\\ndef elegant_spiral(start: int, end: int) -> str:\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\n#### Input\\\\n- `start` (int): The starting point of the spiral.\\\\n- `end` (int): The ending point of the spiral.\\\\n\\\\n#### Output\\\\n- Returns a string representation of the spiral.\", \"code\": \"import math\\\\n\\\\ndef elegant_spiral(start: int, end: int) -> str:\\\\n    result = \\'\\'\\\\n    for i in range(start, end + 1):\\\\n        angle = 2 * math.pi * (math.log(i) / math.log(1.618))\\\\n        distance = i / 10\\\\n        x = round(distance * math.cos(angle))\\\\n        y = round(distance * math.sin(angle))\\\\n        result += \\' \\' if (x ** 2 + y ** 2) > 50 else \\'\\'\\\\n    return result\", \"tests\": [\"assert elegant_spiral(1, 5) == \\'     \\',\\\\n      \\'     \\',\\\\n      \\'     \\',\\\\n      \\'     \\',\\\\n      \\' \\'\", \"n\", \"assert elegant_spiral(10, 20) == \\'\\\\\\\\n     \\' * (10 + 10)\\\\n        .replace(\\'     \\', \\' \\').strip()\"]}'}"
