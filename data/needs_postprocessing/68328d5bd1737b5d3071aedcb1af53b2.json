"{'model': 'qwen2:7b', 'response': '\"{ \\\\\"title\\\\\": \\\\\"Medium: Maximum Subarray Sum with Negative Elements Excluded\\\\\", \\\\\"description\\\\\": \\\\\"\\\\\\\\nA maximum subarray sum problem where you need to find the maximum sum of a contiguous subsequence in an array, excluding any elements that are negative. This question is medium difficulty because it requires understanding and implementing algorithms like Kadane\\'s algorithm with additional checks for negative numbers.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n#### Function Signature\\\\\\\\n```python\\\\\\\\ndef max_subarray_sum_without_negatives(arr: list) -> int:\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n#### Input\\\\\\\\n- `arr` (list): A non-empty array of integers, possibly including both positive and negative values.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n#### Output\\\\\\\\n- Returns the maximum sum of a contiguous subsequence from the input array excluding any negative numbers. If no such subarray exists or all elements are negative, returns 0 as the max possible sum.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n#### Constraints:\\\\\\\\n- Length of arr: \\\\\\\\(1 \\\\\\\\leq |arr| \\\\\\\\leq 10^5\\\\\\\\)\\\\\\\\n- Elements in arr: \\\\\\\\(-10^3 \\\\\\\\leq element \\\\\\\\leq 10^3\\\\\\\\)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n#### Example Tests:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\'assert max_subarray_sum_without_negatives([1, -2, 3, -4, 5]) == 8\\', \\\\\\\\n\\'assert max_subarray_sum_without_negatives([-1, -2, -3, -4]) == 0\\',\\\\\\\\n\\'assert max_subarray_sum_without_negatives([2, -1, 3, -4, 6]) == 9\\'\\\\\\\\n\\\\\" }\"'}"
