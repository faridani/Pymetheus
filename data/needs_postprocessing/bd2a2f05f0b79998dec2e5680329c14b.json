"{'model': 'mistral:latest', 'response': '\"{ \\\\\"title\\\\\": \\\\\"\\'Polybius Squared Decoder\\' (Medium)\\\\\", \\\\\"description\\\\\": \\\\\"The Polybius square is a tool used to encode and decode messages in a simple substitution cipher. In this cipher, each digit from 1 to 25 corresponds to a pair of letters: `1` corresponds to `AB`, `2` corresponds to `CD`, `3` corresponds to `EF`, and so on. Write a function `decode_polybius` that takes in a string of digits representing a Polybius-encoded message, and returns the decoded message.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n#### Function Signature\\\\\\\\n```python\\\\\\\\ndef decode_polybius(encoded: str) -> str:\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n#### Input\\\\\\\\n- `encoded` (str): A string of digits representing a Polybius-encoded message.
