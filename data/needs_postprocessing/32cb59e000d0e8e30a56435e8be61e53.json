The representation is a list of lists, where each inner list represents a row in the Sudoku grid. Each element in the inner list can be either 0 (representing an empty cell) or a number from 1 to 9 (representing a filled cell). A valid Sudoku grid must have the following properties:\\\\n\\\\n- The grid is 9x9.\\\\n- The values from 1 to 9 are used only once in each row, column and 3x3 sub-grid.\\\\n- If a cell is empty (represented by 0), it can be filled with any number from 1 to 9.\\\\n\\\\n#### Function Signature\\\\n```python\\\\ndef is_valid_sudoku(grid: list[list[int]]) -> bool:\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\n#### Input\\\\n- `grid` (list[list[int]]): A representation of a partially filled Sudoku grid.\\\\n\\\\n#### Output\\\\n- Returns `True` if the input grid is valid, `False` otherwise.\\\", \\\"code\\\": \\\"\\\\nimport copy\\\\n\\\\ndef is_valid_sudoku(grid: list[list[int]]) -> bool:\\\\n    # Check rows\\\\n    for row in grid:\\\\n        row_values = set()\\\\n        for value in row:\\\\n            if value == 0:\\\\n                continue\\\\n            if value not in row_values:\\\\n                row_values.add(value)\\\\n            else:\\\\n                return False\\\\n\\\\n    # Check columns\\\\n    for col_idx in range(9):\\\\n        col_values = set()\\\\n        for row in grid:\\\\n            value = row[col_idx]\\\\n            if value == 0:\\\\n                continue\\\\n            if value not in col_values:\\\\n                col_values.add(value)\\\\n            else:\\\\n                return False\\\\n\\\\n    # Check 3x3 sub-grids\\\\n    for i in range(0, 9, 3):\\\\n        for j in range(0, 9, 3):\\\\n            sub_grid_values = set()\\\\n            for k in range(3):\\\\n                for row_idx in range(i, i + 3):\\\\n                    value = grid[row_idx][j + k]\\\\n                    if value == 0:\\\\n                        continue\\\\n                    if value not in sub_grid_values:\\\\n                        sub_grid_values.add(value)\\\\n                    else:\\\\n                        return False\\\\n\\\\n    return True\\\", \\\"tests\\\": [\\\"assert is_valid_sudoku([[5,3,0,0,7,0,0,0,0], [6,0,0,1,9,5,0,0,0], [0,9,8,0,0,0,0,6,0], [1,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0], [4,0,6,7,0,0,0,0,9], [0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0], [0,0,0,0,0,9,8,0,0], [5,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6], [0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0]]) == True\\\", \\\"assert is_valid_sudoku([[1,2,3],[4,5,6],[7,8,9]]) == False\\\", \\\"assert is_valid_sudoku([[0,0,0],[0,0,0],[0,0,0]]) == True\\\"] }\""
