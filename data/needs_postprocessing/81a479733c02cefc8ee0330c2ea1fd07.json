It consists of three rods and a number of disks, each with a different size. Initially, all the disks are placed on one rod in order from largest to smallest. The goal is to move all the disks to another rod. You can only move one disk at a time, and you must put it on top of the other disks if they are already moved.\\n\\n#### Function Signature\\n```python\\ndef hanoi_move_disks(n: int) -> None:\\n```\\n\\n#### Input\\n- `n` (int): The number of disks.\\n\\n#### Output\\n- Prints the moves to move all the disks from the first rod to the third rod. Each move should be printed in the format 'move disk X from rod Y to rod Z'.\", \"code\": \"import math\\n\\ndef hanoi_move_disks(n: int) -> None:\\n    def hanoi_move(rods, n):\\n        if n == 1:\\n            print(f\", \"rods[2]}\": \"break\\n\\n    rods = ['A', 'B', 'C']\\n    hanoi_move(rods, n)\\n\\nhanoi_move_disks(4)\", \"tests\": [\"assert hanoi_move_disks(1) == None\", \"assert hanoi_move_disks(2) == None\", \"assert hanoi_move_disks(3) == None\", \"assert hanoi_move_disks(4) == None\"]}"
