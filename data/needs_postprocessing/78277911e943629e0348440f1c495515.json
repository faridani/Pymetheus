Find the number of palindromic substrings in it, which have all the same characters as their reversed counterparts.\\r\\n\\r\\nFunction Signature:\\r\\n- `count_palindrome_substrings(s: str) -> int`: Returns an integer value representing the count of such substrings.\\r\\n\\r\\nInput:\\r\\n- `s` (str): A string containing only alphanumeric characters.\\r\\n\\r\\nOutput:\\r\\n- An integer value representing the count of palindromic substrings in `s` with all same characters as their reversed counterparts. \\r\\n\\r\\nConstraints:\\r\\n- The input string `s` can have a maximum length of 10^5.\\r\\n- Each character in the string is either an uppercase or lowercase letter, or a digit between 0 and 9.\\r\\n- There are no leading, trailing, or multiple spaces in `s`.\\r\\n\\r\\nHints:\\r\\n- The problem can be solved by first removing all non-alphanumeric characters from the input string and then checking if each substring is palindromic. If it's a palindrome and has only one unique character, we increment the count.\\r\\n- We can use the `set()` function to check for uniqueness of characters in a string.\\r\\n\\r\\nTest Cases:\\r\\n```python\\r\\nassert count_palindrome_substrings(\\\"abba\\\") == 2 # \\\"a\\\", \\\"b\\\" and \\\"bb\\\" are palindromic substrings with same characters as their reversed counterparts.\\r\\nassert count_palindrome_substrings(\\\"racecar\\\") == 1 # Only \\\"racecar\\\" is a valid palindrome substring that has the same characters as its reversed counterpart.\\r\\nassert count_palindrome_substrings(\", \"A man, a plan, a canal, Panama!\\\") == 2 # \\\"an\", \"am\\\" and \\\"man\\\" are valid palindromic substrings with same characters as their reversed counterparts.\\r\\nassert count_palindrome_substrings(\\\"No 'x' in Nixon\\\") == 2 # \\\"No\\\" and \\\"in\\\" are valid palindromic substrings that have the same characters as their reversed counterparts.\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\nExample:\\r\\n\\r\\n{\\r\\n    \\\"title\\\": \\\"Count Palindrome Substrings\", \"description\\\": \\\"You are given a string `s` containing alphanumeric characters only.
