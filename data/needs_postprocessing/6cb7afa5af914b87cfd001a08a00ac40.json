"{'model': 'gemma2:27b', 'response': '\"{ \\\\\"title\\\\\": \\\\\"Hard: Alien Message Decoder\\\\\", \\\\\"description\\\\\": \\\\\"You have intercepted an alien message, but it\\'s encoded using a complex system.  The aliens use a prime-based cipher where each letter is represented by its position in the alphabet multiplied by a unique prime number.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n#### Function Signature\\\\\\\\n```python\\\\\\\\ndef decode_alien_message(message: str) -> str:\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n#### Input\\\\\\\\n- `message` (str): A string containing the encoded alien message. Each group of digits represents a letter.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n#### Output\\\\\\\\n- Returns the decoded message as a string.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n#### Example\\\\\\\\nIf the prime numbers used are [2, 3, 5, 7, 11, ...], then \\'1206\\' would decode to \\'C\\': (1*2) = 2, (2*3) = 6, (0*5) = 0,  giving the letter at position 2+6 = 8 in the alphabet.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n#### Constraints\\\\\\\\n- The message will only contain digits.\\\\\\\\n- The prime numbers used are guaranteed to be unique and ordered. You can assume a fixed set of primes is being used for decoding.\\\\\", \\\\\"code\\\\\": \\\\\"def decode_alien_message(message: str) -> str:\\\\\\\\n    primes = [2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29]\\\\\\\\n    decoded_message = \\'\\'\\\\\\\\n    for group in message.split(\\' \\'):\\\\\\\\n        letter_position = sum([int(digit) * primes[i] for i, digit in enumerate(group)])\\\\\\\\n        decoded_message += chr(letter_position + ord(\\'a\\'))\\\\\\\\n    return decoded_message\\\\\", \\\\\"tests\\\\\": [\\\\\"assert decode_alien_message(\\\\\\\\\\\\\"1206 84 152\\\\\\\\\\\\\") == \\\\\\\\\\\\\"cab\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\", \\\\\"assert decode_alien_message(\\\\\\\\\\\\\"36 22 105 51\\\\\\\\\\\\\") == \\\\\\\\\\\\\"dear\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\", \\\\\"assert decode_alien_message(\\\\\\\\\\\\\"440 165 77 33\\\\\\\\\\\\\") == \\\\\\\\\\\\\"hate\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\"] }\"'}"
