It can contain letters only.\\\\\\\\n- `second` (str): The second string in which to find the anagrams of the first string. It can contain letters, spaces, and punctuation.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n#### Output\\\\\\\\n- Returns a list of all the substrings found in the second string that are anagrams of the first string. The list elements should be strings themselves.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\", \\\\\"code\\\\\": \\\\\"import collections\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\ndef find_anagrams(first: str, second: str) -> list:\\\\\\\\n    # Convert the first string to a dictionary where keys are letters and values are their counts\\\\\\\\n    first_count = collections.Counter(first)\\\\\\\\n    \\\\\\\\n    # Find all substrings in the second string that have the same letter count as the first string\\\\\\\\n    anagrams = [sub for i, sub in enumerate(second) if 0 < len(second[i:]) <= len(first) and collections.Counter(second[i:i+len(first)]) == first_count]\\\\\\\\n    return anagrams\\\\\", \\\\\"tests\\\\\": [\\\\\"assert find_anagrams(\\\\\\\\\\\\\"listen\\\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\\\"Time runs from Caesar to old town down\\\\\\\\\\\\\") == [\\\\\\\\\\\\\"enlists\\\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\\\"silent\\\\\\\\\\\\\"]\\\\\", \\\\\"assert find_anagrams(\\\\\\\\\\\\\"actinia\\\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\\\"The action is in an act of violence\\\\\\\\\\\\\") == []\\\\\", \\\\\"assert find_anagrams(\\\\\\\\\\\\\"python\\\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\\\"Python\\'s a great language, it\\'s easy and fun to learn!\\\\\\\\\\\\\") == [\\\\\\\\\\\\\"yhtep\\\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\\\"thyper\\\\\\\\\\\\\"]\\\\\"] }\"'}"
