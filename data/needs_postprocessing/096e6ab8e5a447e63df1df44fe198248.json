Write a function `goldbach` that takes an input number and checks if it is an even number, then checks if it can be expressed as the sum of two prime numbers.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n#### Function Signature\\\\\\\\n```python\\\\\\\\ndef goldbach(n: int) -> list or None:\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n#### Input\\\\\\\\n- `n` (int): An integer greater than 2.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n#### Output\\\\\\\\n- If the input number can be expressed as the sum of two prime numbers, return a list containing the two primes. If it cannot be expressed as such, return None.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n#### Constraints and Hints\\\\\\\\n- You do not need to prove or disprove Goldbach\\'s Conjecture itself. Simply write a function that checks if an input number is an exception to the conjecture.\\\\\\\\n- If you are unsure of how to find primes, consider using the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\", \\\\\"code\\\\\": \\\\\"def goldbach(n: int) -> list or None:\\\\\\\\n    # Check if n is even\\\\\\\\n    if n % 2 != 0:\\\\\\\\n        return None\\\\\\\\n    # Create a list to store primes found thus far\\\\\\\\n    primes = [2]\\\\\\\\n    # Implement the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm\\\\\\\\n    sieve = [True] * (n + 1)\\\\\\\\nsieve[0] = sieve[1] = False\\\\\\\\n    for i in range(3, int(n**0.5) + 2):\\\\\\\\n        if sieve[i]:\\\\\\\\n            # Mark multiples of i as composite\\\\\\\\n            for j in range(i*i, n+1, i):\\\\\\\\n                sieve[j] = False\\\\\\\\n    # Iterate through primes to check if they sum to n\\\\\\\\n    for p in primes:\\\\\\\\n        if (n - p) in primes or (n - p) in sieve:\\\\\\\\n            return [p, n - p]\\\\\\\\n    return None\\\\\", \\\\\"tests\\\\\": [\\\\\"assert goldbach(4) == [2, 2]\\\\\", \\\\\"assert goldbach(6) == [3, 3]\\\\\", \\\\\"assert goldbach(9) == [3, 6]\\\\\", \\\\\"assert goldbach(10) == [2, 4] or goldbach(5) == [2, 3]\\\\\", \\\\\"assert goldbach(17) == None\\\\\"] }\"'}"
