"{'model': 'gemma2:27b', 'response': '\"{ \\\\\"title\\\\\": \\\\\"Hard - Number Spiral Diagonals\\\\\", \\\\\"description\\\\\": \\\\\"You are given a positive integer $n$ representing the size of a square spiral.  Your task is to write a function `diagonal_sum(n)` that calculates the sum of all diagonal elements in this spiral.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n#### Function Signature\\\\\\\\n```python\\\\\\\\ndef diagonal_sum(n: int) -> int:\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n#### Input\\\\\\\\n- `n` (int): The size of the square spiral. Assume $n$ is a positive integer greater than 0.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n#### Output\\\\\\\\n- Returns the sum of all diagonal elements in the spiral as an integer.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n#### Example\\\\\\\\nFor $n=5$, the spiral would look like:\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n17  16  15  14  13\\\\\\\\n18   5   4   3  12\\\\\\\\n19   6   1   2  11\\\\\\\\n20   7   8   9  10\\\\\\\\n21  22  23  24  25\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\nThe diagonal elements are 1, 5, 9, and 25. Their sum is 40.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n#### Hints\\\\\\\\n- Think about the pattern of how diagonal elements change as you move through the spiral. - You may want to use nested loops to generate the spiral.\\\\\", \\\\\"code\\\\\": \\\\\"def diagonal_sum(n: int) -> int:\\\\\\\\n    total = 1  # Initialize with the center element\\\\\\\\n    step = 2\\\\\\\\n    for i in range(3, n + 1, 2):\\\\\\\\n        total += (i * i - step)\\\\\\\\n        total += (i * i - 2 * step)\\\\\\\\n        total += (i * i - 3 * step)\\\\\\\\n        step += 2 * (n - i // 2)\\\\\\\\n    return total\\\\\\\\n\\\\\", \\\\\"tests\\\\\": [\\\\\"assert diagonal_sum(1) == 1\\\\\", \\\\\"assert diagonal_sum(3) == 25\\\\\", \\\\\"assert diagonal_sum(5) == 101\\\\\", \\\\\"assert diagonal_sum(7) == 261\\\\\"] }\"'}"
