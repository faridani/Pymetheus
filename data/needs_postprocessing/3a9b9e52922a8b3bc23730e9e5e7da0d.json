Write a function `is_prime` and `goldbach_conjecture` that checks if a given number is prime and solves the Goldbach\\'s conjecture for a given even number.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n#### Function Signatures\\\\\\\\n```python\\\\\\\\ndef is_prime(n: int) -> bool:\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n```python\\\\\\\\ndef goldbach_conjecture(n: int) -> None:\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n#### Input\\\\\\\\n- `n` (int): An even number greater than 2.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n#### Output\\\\\\\\n- The function `is_prime` returns `True` if the input is a prime number, `False` otherwise.\\\\\\\\n- The function `goldbach_conjecture` prints out two prime numbers that sum up to the given `n`.
