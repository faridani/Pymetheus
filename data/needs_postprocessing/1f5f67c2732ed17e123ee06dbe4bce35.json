The list contains only integers 0 and 1.\\\\\\\\n2. The integers represent the following operations: 0 means push an element to the stack, and 1 means pop the topmost element from the stack. The stack is initially empty.\\\\\\\\n3. For every operation 1 (pop), there must be a corresponding previous operation 0 (push) at a later index.\\\\\\\\n4. No operation 1 (pop) can occur without an earlier corresponding push operation.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n#### Function Signature\\\\\\\\n```python\\\\\\\\ndef is_valid_stack(arr: List[int]) -> bool:\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n#### Input\\\\\\\\n- `arr` (List[int]): A non-empty list of integers 0 and/or 1.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n#### Output\\\\\\\\n- Returns `True` if the input list represents a valid stack sequence, `False` otherwise.\\'\\\\\", \\\\\"code\\\\\": \\\\\"def is_valid_stack(arr: List[int]) -> bool:\\\\\\\\n    # Keep track of the stack using a dictionary with keys as indices and values as count of elements at those indices\\\\\\\\n    stack = {i: 0 for i in range(len(arr))}\\\\\\\\n    # Iterate through the list\\\\\\\\n    for idx, num in enumerate(arr):\\\\\\\\n        # If it\\'s a push operation, increment the count at the corresponding index\\\\\\\\n        if num == 0:\\\\\\\\n            stack[idx] += 1\\\\\\\\n        # If it\\'s a pop operation and the count is greater than zero at the current index,\\\\\\\\n        # decrement the count.
