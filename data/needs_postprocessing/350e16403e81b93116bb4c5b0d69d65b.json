"{'model': 'mistral:latest', 'response': '\"{ \\\\\"title\\\\\": \\\\\"\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Is it a CapFirst Palindrome?\\\\\\\\\\\\\" (Easy)\\\\\", \\\\\"description\\\\\": \\\\\"A palindrome is a word, phrase, number, or other sequence of characters that reads the same forward and backward (ignoring spaces, punctuation, and capitalization).
