Write a function `are_anagrams` that checks if two given strings are anagrams.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n#### Function Signature\\\\\\\\n```python\\\\\\\\ndef are_anagrams(s1: str, s2: str) -> bool:\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n#### Input\\\\\\\\n- `s1` (str): A string that may contain letters and nothing else.\\\\\\\\n- `s2` (str): Another string that may contain letters and nothing else.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n#### Output\\\\\\\\n- Returns `True` if the input strings are anagrams, `False` otherwise.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n#### Hint\\\\\\\\nFirst, convert both strings to lowercase. Then, sort their characters in alphabetical order. If the sorted characters of both strings are identical, the strings are anagrams.\\\\\", \\\\\"code\\\\\": \\\\\"import operator\\\\\\\\ndef are_anagrams(s1: str, s2: str) -> bool:\\\\\\\\n    # Convert to lowercase and remove duplicates\\\\\\\\ns1 = list(sorted(set(s1.lower())))\\\\\\\\ns2 = list(sorted(set(s2.lower())))\\\\\\\\n    # Check if the sorted characters are identical for both strings\\\\\\\\n    return s1 == s2\\\\\", \\\\\"tests\\\\\": [\\\\\"assert are_anagrams(\\'listen\\', \\'silent\\') == True\\\\\", \\\\\"assert are_anagrams(\\'hello\\', \\'world\\') == False\\\\\", \\\\\"assert are_anagrams(\\'actors\\', \\'racist\\') == True\\\\\"] }\"'}"
