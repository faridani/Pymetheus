The grid is represented by a 2D list, where each element is either an integer from 1 to 9 or 0. If it's 0, then the cell is empty and can be any number from 1 to 9.\\\\n\\\\n#### Function Signature\\\\n```python\\\\ndef solve_sudoku(board: list[list[int]]) -> list[list[int]]:\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\n#### Input\\\\n- `board` (list[list[int]]): A partially filled-in Sudoku grid, represented as a 2D list of integers.
