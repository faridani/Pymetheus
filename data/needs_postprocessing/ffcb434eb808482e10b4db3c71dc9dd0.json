Each castle has a strength value, represented by an integer. A knight can attack any adjacent castle (i.e., castles with indices differing by 1). \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe objective is to determine the minimum number of knights needed to conquer all castles. A castle is conquered when its strength reaches zero or below.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nEach knight has a fixed attack power, also represented by an integer. Knights attack simultaneously each turn.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n#### Function Signature\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n```python\\\\\\\\ndef min_knights(castle_strengths: list[int], knight_attack: int) -> int:\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n#### Input\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n- `castle_strengths`: A list of integers representing the initial strength values of each castle.\\\\\\\\n- `knight_attack`: An integer representing the attack power of each knight.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n#### Output\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n- Returns an integer representing the minimum number of knights needed to conquer all castles.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n#### Constraints\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n- 1 <= len(castle_strengths) <= 10^5\\\\\\\\n- 1 <= castle_strengths[i] <= 10^9\\\\\\\\n- 1 <= knight_attack <= 10^9\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n#### Hints\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n- Think about how to efficiently simulate the attacking process.\\\\\\\\n- Consider using a queue or deque to keep track of castles that need to be attacked.\\\\\", \\\\\"code\\\\\": \\\\\"from collections import deque\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\ndef min_knights(castle_strengths: list[int], knight_attack: int) -> int:\\\\\\\\n    n = len(castle_strengths)\\\\\\\\n    castles = deque([(i, castle_strengths[i]) for i in range(n)])\\\\\\\\n    knights = 0\\\\\\\\n    while castles:\\\\\\\\n        knights += 1\\\\\\\\n        for _ in range(len(castles)):\\\\\\\\n            i, strength = castles.popleft()\\\\\\\\n            strength -= knight_attack\\\\\\\\n            if strength > 0:\\\\\\\\n                castles.append((i, strength))\\\\\\\\n    return knights\\\\\", \\\\\"tests\\\\\": [\\\\\"assert min_knights([5, 3, 2, 4], 2) == 4\\\\\", \\\\\"assert min_knights([10, 8, 6, 4, 2], 3) == 5\\\\\", \\\\\"assert min_knights([1, 1, 1, 1], 1) == 4\\\\\", \\\\\"assert min_knights([1000000, 1000000], 1) == 1000000\\\\\"] }\"'}"
