For example, the 6th triangular number is 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 = 21.\\\\nWrite a function `triangular_sum` that calculates the sum of all triangular numbers up to and including a given input number `n`. The function should return this sum as an integer.\\\\n\\\\n#### Function Signature\\\\n```python\\\\ndef triangular_sum(n: int) -> int:\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\n#### Input\\\\n- `n` (int): A positive integer.\\\\n\\\\n#### Output\\\\n- Returns the sum of all triangular numbers up to and including `n`.\\\", \\\"code\\\": \\\"def triangular_sum(n: int) -> int:\\\\n    total = 0\\\\n    for i in range(1, n + 1):\\\\n        total += (i * (i + 1)) // 2\\\\n    return total\\\\n\\\", \\\"tests\\\": [\\\"assert triangular_sum(10) == 55\\\", \\\"assert triangular_sum(15) == 120\\\", \\\"assert triangular_sum(20) == 210\\\", \\\"assert triangular_sum(-5) == 0\\\"] }\""
