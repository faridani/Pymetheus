"{'model': 'phi4:latest', 'response': '\"{ \\\\\"title\\\\\": \\\\\"Medium Python Coding Question: Count Unique Words\\\\\", \\\\\"description\\\\\": \\\\\"You are given a string that contains multiple words separated by spaces. Your task is to write a function `count_unique_words` that returns the number of unique words in the input string. The comparison should be case-insensitive, and punctuation marks such as periods, commas, etc., should be ignored.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n#### Function Signature\\\\\\\\n```python\\\\\\\\ndef count_unique_words(text: str) -> int:\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n#### Input\\\\\\\\n- `text` (str): A string containing multiple words separated by spaces. The string may contain letters, numbers, spaces, and punctuation marks.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n#### Output\\\\\\\\n- Returns an integer representing the number of unique words in the input string.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n#### Constraints\\\\\\\\n- The input string can be empty or consist only of whitespace characters.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n#### Hints\\\\\\\\n- Consider using Python\\'s `str.lower()` method to handle case-insensitivity.\\\\\\\\n- Use Python\\'s `str.translate()` and `str.maketrans()` methods to remove punctuation marks.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\", \\\\\"code\\\\\": \\\\\"import string\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\ndef count_unique_words(text: str) -> int:\\\\\\\\n    # Convert text to lowercase\\\\\\\\n    text = text.lower()\\\\\\\\n    # Remove punctuation using translate method\\\\\\\\n    translator = str.maketrans(\\'\\', \\'\\', string.punctuation)\\\\\\\\n    text = text.translate(translator)\\\\\\\\n    # Split the text into words\\\\\\\\n    words = text.split()\\\\\\\\n    # Use a set to find unique words and return its length\\\\\\\\n    return len(set(words))\\\\\\\\n\\\\\", \\\\\"tests\\\\\": [\\\\\"assert count_unique_words(\\'Hello, world!
