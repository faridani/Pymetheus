A perfect square is an integer that is the square of another integer. For example, 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, and 36 are perfect squares because they can be written as 1^2, 2^2, 3^2, 4^2, 5^2, and 6^2 respectively.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n#### Function Signature\\\\\\\\n```python\\\\\\\\ndef is_perfect_square(n: int) -> bool:\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n#### Input\\\\\\\\n- `n` (int): A positive integer to check if it\\'s a perfect square.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n#### Output\\\\\\\\n- Returns `True` if the input number is a perfect square, `False` otherwise.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\", \\\\\"code\\\\\": \\\\\"def is_perfect_square(n: int) -> bool:\\\\\\\\n    # Handle edge cases\\\\\\\\n    if n <= 0: return False\\\\\\\\n    sqrt = int(math.sqrt(n))\\\\\\\\n    return sqrt * sqrt == n\\\\\", \\\\\"tests\\\\\": [\\\\\"assert is_perfect_square(4) == True\\\\\", \\\\\"assert is_perfect_square(9) == True\\\\\", \\\\\"assert is_perfect_square(10) == False\\\\\", \\\\\"assert is_perfect_square(256) == True\\\\\"] }\"'}"
