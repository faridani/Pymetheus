"{'model': 'gemma2:27b', 'response': '\"{ \\\\\"title\\\\\": \\\\\"Hard:  Minimum Edit Distance with Wildcards\\\\\", \\\\\"description\\\\\": \\\\\"Given two strings, `str1` and `str2`, find the minimum edit distance between them. You are allowed to use three types of edits:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* **Insertion:** Insert a character into `str1`. \\\\\\\\n* **Deletion:** Delete a character from `str1`. \\\\\\\\n* **Substitution:** Replace a character in `str1` with another character.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIn addition, you can also use wildcards represented by \\'*\\'. A wildcard \\'*\\' can match any single character in `str2`. Find the minimum edit distance considering these wildcards. \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n#### Function Signature\\\\\\\\n```python\\\\\\\\ndef min_edit_distance_with_wildcards(str1: str, str2: str) -> int:\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n#### Input\\\\\\\\n* `str1` (str): The first string.\\\\\\\\n* `str2` (str): The second string. \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n#### Output\\\\\\\\n- Returns the minimum edit distance between `str1` and `str2`, considering wildcards.\\\\\", \\\\\"code\\\\\": \\\\\"def min_edit_distance_with_wildcards(str1: str, str2: str) -> int:\\\\\\\\n    n = len(str1)\\\\\\\\n    m = len(str2)\\\\\\\\n    dp = [[float(\\'inf\\')] * (m + 1) for _ in range(n + 1)]\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    # Initialization\\\\\\\\n    dp[0][0] = 0\\\\\\\\n    for i in range(1, n + 1):\\\\\\\\n        dp[i][0] = i\\\\\\\\n    for j in range(1, m + 1):\\\\\\\\n        dp[0][j] = j\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    # Fill the dp table\\\\\\\\n    for i in range(1, n + 1):\\\\\\\\n        for j in range(1, m + 1):\\\\\\\\n            if str1[i - 1] == str2[j - 1] or str2[j - 1] == \\'*\\':\\\\\\\\n                dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j - 1]\\\\\\\\n            else:\\\\\\\\n                dp[i][j] = min(\\\\\\\\n                    dp[i - 1][j] + 1,  # Deletion\\\\\\\\n                    dp[i][j - 1] + 1,  # Insertion\\\\\\\\n                    dp[i - 1][j - 1] + 1  # Substitution\\\\\\\\n                )\\\\\\\\n    return dp[n][m]\\\\\", \\\\\"tests\\\\\": [\\\\\"assert min_edit_distance_with_wildcards(\\'abc\\', \\'abd\\') == 1\\\\\", \\\\\"assert min_edit_distance_with_wildcards(\\'intention\\', \\'execution\\') == 5\\\\\", \\\\\"assert min_edit_distance_with_wildcards(\\'abcdefg\\', \\'a*c*efg\\') == 0\\\\\", \\\\\"assert min_edit_distance_with_wildcards(\\'horse\\', \\'*orse\\') == 1\\\\\"] }\"'}"
