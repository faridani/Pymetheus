The goal is to move the entire stack to another rod, obeying the following simple rules:\\\\n- Only one disk can be moved at a time.\\\\n- Each move consists of taking the upper disk from one of the stacks and placing it on top of another stack or on an empty rod.\\\\n\\\\nWrite a function `hanoi_move` that takes as input the current state of the rods, the starting rod (A), the ending rod (B) and the number of disks to move. It should return whether it's possible to make the specified move according to the rules of the Tower of Hanoi.\\\\n\\\\n#### Function Signature\\\\n```python\\\\ndef hanoi_move(rods: list, start_rod: str, end_rod: str, num_disks: int) -> bool:\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\n#### Input\\\\n- `rods` (list): A list of three lists representing the current state of the rods.\\\\n- `start_rod` (str): The starting rod (A or B).\\\\n- `end_rod` (str): The ending rod (A or B).\\\\n- `num_disks` (int): The number of disks to move.\\\\n\\\\n#### Output\\\\n- Returns `True` if the specified move is possible, `False` otherwise.\\\", \\\"code\\\": \\\"def hanoi_move(rods: list, start_rod: str, end_rod: str, num_disks: int) -> bool:\\\\n    for i in range(len(rods)):\\\\n        if len(rods[i]) > num_disks:\\\\n            return False\\\\n    if rods[0][len(rods[0])-1-num_disks] == rods[2][0]:\\\\n        return False\\\\n    if start_rod == end_rod or abs(ord(start_rod)-ord('A')) == abs(ord(end_rod)-ord('C')):\\\\n        return False\\\\n    return True\\\", \\\"tests\\\": [\\\"assert hanoi_move([['1'], ['2', '3'], []], 'A', 'B', 1) == True\\\", \\\"assert hanoi_move([['1'], ['2', '3'], []], 'B', 'A', 1) == False\\\", \\\"assert hanoi_move([['1', '2', '3'], [], []], 'A', 'C', 3) == True\\\"] }\""
