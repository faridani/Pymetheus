The objective of the game is to move the entire stack to another rod, obeying the following simple rules:\\\\n\\\\n1. Only one disk can be moved at a time.\\\\n2. Each move consists of taking the uppermost disk from one of the stacks and placing it on top of another stack or on an empty rod.\\\\n3. No disk may be placed on top of a smaller disk.\\\\n\\\\nWrite a function `hanoi` that takes as input three lists representing the states of the rods (from bottom to top) and returns the minimum number of moves required to move all disks from the first rod to the third rod.\\\\n\\\\n#### Function Signature\\\\n```python\\\\ndef hanoi(rod1: list, rod2: list, rod3: list) -> int:\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\n#### Input\\\\n- `rod1`, `rod2`, and `rod3` (list): Lists of integers representing the states of the rods.\\\\n\\\\n#### Output\\\\n- Returns the minimum number of moves required to move all disks from the first rod to the third rod.\\\\n\\\", \\\"code\\\": \\\"from collections import deque\\\\n\\\\ndef hanoi(rod1: list, rod2: list, rod3: list) -> int:\\\\n    # Initialize a queue for BFS\\\\n    queue = deque([(rod1, rod2, rod3, 0)])\\\\n    # Initialize a set to keep track of visited states\\\\n    visited = set((tuple(rod1), tuple(rod2), tuple(rod3)))\\\\n    while queue:\\\\n        rod1_state, rod2_state, rod3_state, moves_made = queue.popleft()\\\\n        if not rod1_state and not rod2_state and rod3_state:\\\\n            return moves_made\\\\n        for i in range(len(rod1_state), 0, -1):\\\\n            disk = rod1_state[i-1]\\\\n            new_rod1_state = rod1_state[:i-1]\\\\n            if not new_rod1_state or max(new_rod1_state) < disk:\\\\n                for j in range(len(rod2_state), 0, -1):\\\\n                    if rod2_state[j-1] == disk:\\\\n                        new_rod2_state = rod2_state[:j-1]\\\\n                        new_rod3_state = [disk] + (list(rod3_state) or [])\\\\n                        if (tuple(new_rod1_state), tuple(new_rod2_state), tuple(new_rod3_state)) not in visited:\\\\n                            queue.append((new_rod1_state, new_rod2_state, new_rod3_state, moves_made+1))\\\\n                            visited.add((tuple(new_rod1_state), tuple(new_rod2_state), tuple(new_rod3_state)))\\\\n    return -1\\\", \\\"tests\\\": [\\\"assert hanoi([5], [4], []) == 10\\\", \\\"assert hanoi([], [], [3]) == 0\\\", \\\"assert hanoi([2, 1], [], [3]) == 3\\\", \\\"assert hanoi([], [1, 2], [3]) == 4\\\"] }\""
