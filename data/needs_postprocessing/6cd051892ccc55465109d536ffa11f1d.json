Fill in the blank cells with the correct numbers from 1 to 9 such that each row, column and 3x3 sub-grid contains each number exactly once.\\\\n\\\\n#### Function Signature\\\\n```python\\\\ndef solve_sudoku(grid: list[list[int]]) -> bool:\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\n#### Input\\\\n- `grid` (list[list[int]]): A 2D list representing the Sudoku grid. The list is composed of lists, where each inner list has exactly 9 elements. Elements in the inner lists can be either blank (represented by a 0) or filled with numbers from 1 to 9.\\\\n\\\\n#### Output\\\\n- Returns `True` if it's possible to fill in the blank cells and make the Sudoku grid valid, `False` otherwise.\\\\n\\\", \\\"code\\\": \\\"def solve_sudoku(grid: list[list[int]]) -> bool:\\\\n    def is_valid(num: int, row: int, col: int) -> bool:\\\\n        for i in range(9):\\\\n            if grid[row][i] == num or grid[i][col] == num:\\\\n                return False\\\\n        start_row = row - row % 3\\\\n        start_col = col - col % 3\\\\n        for i in range(3):\\\\n            for j in range(3):\\\\n                if grid[start_row + i][start_col + j] == num:\\\\n                    return False\\\\n        return True\\\\n\\\\n    def solve():\\\\n        for i in range(9):\\\\n            for j in range(9):\\\\n                if grid[i][j] == 0:\\\\n                    for num in range(1, 10):\\\\n                        if is_valid(num, i, j):\\\\n                            grid[i][j] = num\\\\n                            if solve():\\\\n                                return True\\\\n                            grid[i][j] = 0\\\\n                    return False\\\\n        return True\\\\n\\\\n    return solve()\\\", \\\"tests\\\": [\\\"assert solve_sudoku([[5,3,4,6,7,8,9,1,2],[6,7,8,9,1,2,3,4,5],[2,1,9,8,4,3,5,6,7],[8,5,9,1,6,4,2,3,7],[4,2,6,5,3,7,8,9,1],[7,1,3,9,2,4,5,6,8],[9,6,1,3,5,7,4,2,8],[3,4,8,5,6,2,1,7,9],[1,9,5,7,3,6,4,8,2]] == True\\\", \\\"assert solve_sudoku([[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]] == False\\\"] }\""
