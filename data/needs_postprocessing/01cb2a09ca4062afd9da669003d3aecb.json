They've sent us a message encoded in their alphabet, but we don't know what any of their symbols mean. Luckily, they also included a Rosetta Stone-like translation guide with a few common Earth words and their alien equivalents. Your task is to write a function `decode_alien_message` that takes two arguments:\\\\n\\\\n*  `alien_message`: A string containing the message in the alien alphabet.\\\\n* `translation_guide`: A dictionary mapping Earth words (strings) to their alien alphabet counterparts (also strings).\\\\n\\\\nThe function should analyze the `alien_message` and try to identify Earth words based on the provided `translation_guide`. It should then return a string containing the decoded message with the identified Earth words replaced with their English translations.\\\\n\\\\n**Example:**\\\\nIf the `alien_message` is \\\\\\\"*!@ #$%^& *!@\\\\\\\" and the `translation_guide` is {\\\\\\\"*!@\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"hello\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\"#$%^&\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"world\\\\\\\"}, then the function should return \\\\\\\"hello hello\\\\\\\".\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n#### Function Signature\\\\n```python\\\\ndef decode_alien_message(alien_message: str, translation_guide: dict) -> str:\\\\n\\\\n```\\\", \\\"code\\\": \\\"def decode_alien_message(alien_message: str, translation_guide: dict) -> str:\\\\n    decoded_message = []\\\\n    current_word = ''\\\\n    for symbol in alien_message:\\\\n        current_word += symbol\\\\n        if current_word in translation_guide:\\\\n            decoded_message.append(translation_guide[current_word])\\\\n            current_word = ''\\\\n    if current_word:\\\\n        decoded_message.append(current_word)\\\\n    return ' '.join(decoded_message)\\\", \\\"tests\\\": [\\\"assert decode_alien_message('*!@ #$%^& *!@', {'*!@': 'hello', '#$%^&': 'world'}) == 'hello hello'\\\", \\\"assert decode_alien_message('abc def ghi', {}) == 'abc def ghi' \\\", \\\"assert decode_alien_message('123 456 789', {'123': 'one', '456': 'two', '789': 'three'}) == 'one two three'\\\"] }\""
