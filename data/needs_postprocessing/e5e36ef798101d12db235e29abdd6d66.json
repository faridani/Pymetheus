"{'model': 'mistral:latest', 'response': '\"{ \\\\\"title\\\\\": \\\\\"Is it a Pyramid Number? (Easy)\\\\\", \\\\\"description\\\\\": \\\\\"A pyramidal number, also called a triangular number, is a positive integer that can be represented as the sum of an arithmetic progression. For example, 1 is a pyramidal number because it can be expressed as 1 = 1; 3 is a pyramidal number because it can be expressed as 1 + 2; and 6 is a pyramidal number because it can be expressed as 1 + 2 + 3. Write a function `is_pyramid` that checks if a given integer is a pyramidal number.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n#### Function Signature\\\\\\\\n```python\\\\\\\\ndef is_pyramid(n: int) -> bool:\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n#### Input\\\\\\\\n- `n` (int): A non-negative integer.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n#### Output\\\\\\\\n- Returns `True` if the input integer is a pyramidal number, `False` otherwise.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\", \\\\\"code\\\\\": \\\\\"def is_pyramid(n: int) -> bool:\\\\\\\\n    # Calculate the square of n and then find its square root\\\\\\\\n    sqr = int(n ** 0.5)\\\\\\\\n    # If the square root is not an integer or if the square of the square root is greater than n, then it\\'s not a pyramidal number\\\\\\\\n    return (sqr * (sqr + 1)) // 2 == n and sqr ** 2 <= n\\\\\", \\\\\"tests\\\\\": [\\\\\"assert is_pyramid(1) == True\\\\\", \\\\\"assert is_pyramid(3) == True\\\\\", \\\\\"assert is_pyramid(6) == True\\\\\", \\\\\"assert is_pyramid(10) == False\\\\\"] }\"'}"
