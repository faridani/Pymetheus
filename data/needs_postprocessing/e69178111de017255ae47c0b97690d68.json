Write a function `is_prime_palindrome` that checks if a given natural number is a prime number palindrome.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n#### Function Signature\\\\\\\\n```python\\\\\\\\ndef is_prime_palindrome(n: int) -> bool:\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n#### Input\\\\\\\\n- `n` (int): A natural number that may contain leading zeros.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n#### Output\\\\\\\\n- Returns `True` if the input natural number is a prime number palindrome, `False` otherwise.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n#### Constraints and Hints\\\\\\\\n- You can assume that `n` will always be an integer and it will never exceed 10^18. Use this constraint to optimize your solution.\\\\\\\\n- To check if a number is prime, you can use the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm or any other method that you find efficient.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\", \\\\\"code\\\\\": \\\\\"def is_prime(n):\\\\\\\\n    # Initialize a list of bools indicating whether each number up to n is prime\\\\\\\\n    primes = [True] * (n + 1)\\\\\\\\n    for i in range(2, int(n**0.5) + 1):\\\\\\\\n        if primes[i]:\\\\\\\\n            # Mark multiples of i as non-prime\\\\\\\\n            for j in range(i*i, n+1, i):\\\\\\\\n                primes[j] = False\\\\\\\\n    return primes[n]\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\ndef is_palindrome(n: int) -> bool:\\\\\\\\n    # Convert the number to a string and reverse it\\\\\\\\n    s = str(n) + str(n)[::-1]\\\\\\\\n    # Remove leading zeros from the reversed string\\\\\\\\n    s = s.lstrip(\\'0\\')\\\\\\\\n    return s == s[::-1]\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\ndef is_prime_palindrome(n: int) -> bool:\\\\\\\\n    if not n > 0:\\\\\\\\n        return False\\\\\\\\n    # Check if the number is a palindrome\\\\\\\\n    if not is_palindrome(n):\\\\\\\\n        return False\\\\\\\\n    # Check if the number is prime\\\\\\\\n    if not is_prime(n):\\\\\\\\n        return False\\\\\\\\n    return True\\\\\", \\\\\"tests\\\\\": [\\\\\"assert is_prime_palindrome(3) == True\\\\\", \\\\\"assert is_prime_palindrome(5) == True\\\\\", \\\\\"assert is_prime_palindrome(6) == False\\\\\", \\\\\"assert is_prime_palindrome(7) == True\\\\\", \\\\\"assert is_prime_palindrome(101) == False\\\\\", \\\\\"assert is_prime_palindrome(9009) == True\\\\\", \\\\\"assert is_prime_palindrome(11311) == True\\\\\"] }\"'}"
