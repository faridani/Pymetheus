"{'model': 'gemma2:27b', 'response': '{\"title\": \"Hard: Knights Tour\", \"description\": \"A knight\\'s tour is a sequence of moves by a knight on a chessboard such that the knight visits every square exactly once. Given a chessboard represented as an 8x8 matrix, write a function `knights_tour` that finds one possible knight\\'s tour starting from a given position.\\\\n\\\\n#### Function Signature\\\\n```python\\\\ndef knights_tour(board: list[list[int]], start_row: int, start_col: int) -> list[tuple[int, int]]:\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\n#### Input\\\\n- `board` (list[list[int]]): An 8x8 matrix representing the chessboard. Each element is initialized to 0.\\\\n- `start_row` (int): The row index of the starting position.\\\\n- `start_col` (int): The column index of the starting position.\\\\n\\\\n#### Output\\\\n- Returns a list of tuples, where each tuple represents a square visited in the knight\\'s tour. The first element of the tuple is the row index and the second element is the column index. If no knight\\'s tour is possible, returns an empty list.\", \"code\": \"def knights_tour(board: list[list[int]], start_row: int, start_col: int) -> list[tuple[int, int]]:\\\\n    n = len(board)\\\\n    moves = [(2, 1), (1, 2), (-1, 2), (-2, 1), (-2, -1), (-1, -2), (1, -2), (2, -1)]\\\\n    tour = []\\\\n\\\\n    def is_valid(row: int, col: int) -> bool:\\\\n        return 0 <= row < n and 0 <= col < n and board[row][col] == 0\\\\n\\\\n    def solve(row: int, col: int, step: int) -> bool:\\\\n        if step == n * n:\\\\n            tour.append((row, col))\\\\n            return True\\\\n\\\\n        for move in moves:\\\\n            next_row = row + move[0]\\\\n            next_col = col + move[1]\\\\n            if is_valid(next_row, next_col):\\\\n                board[next_row][next_col] = step + 1\\\\n                if solve(next_row, next_col, step + 1):\\\\n                    tour.append((row, col))\\\\n                    return True\\\\n                board[next_row][next_col] = 0\\\\n        return False\\\\n\\\\n    board[start_row][start_col] = 1\\\\n    if solve(start_row, start_col, 1):\\\\n        return tour[::-1]\\\\n    else:\\\\n        return []\", \"tests\": [\"board = [[0 for _ in range(8)] for _ in range(8)]; assert knights_tour(board, 0, 0) == [(0, 0), (2, 1), (4, 2), (6, 3), (5, 5), (3, 6), (1, 7), (0, 5), (2, 6), (4, 7), (6, 6), (7, 4), (5, 3), (3, 2), (1, 1), (2, 3)], \\'assert knights_tour([[1 for _ in range(8)] for _ in range(8)], 0, 0) == []\\'\", \"board = [[0 for _ in range(8)\"], \"5)]\": \"\"}'}"
