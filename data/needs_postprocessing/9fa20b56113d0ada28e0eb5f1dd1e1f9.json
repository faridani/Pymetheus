You are given a string composed solely of ones and zeros, and your task is to transform it into the lexicographically smallest one by flipping exactly one substring.\\\\n\\\\nYou\\'re allowed to choose any contiguous segment (substring) of the string and invert all its characters (\\'1\\' becomes \\'0\\', and vice versa). \\\\n\\\\nWrite a function `minimize_binary_string` that takes in a binary string as input and returns the minimum possible version after making exactly one flip operation on some substring. Assume you can always make such a change.\\\\n\\\\n#### Function Signature\\\\n```python\\\\ndef minimize_binary_string(binary_str: str) -> str:\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\n#### Input \\\\n- A single non-empty binary string (`binary_str`): a sequence of 0s and 1s, where the length will not exceed \\\\\\\\(2 \\\\times 10^5\\\\\\\\).\\\\n\\\\n#### Output  \\\\nReturn the lexicographically smallest version of `binary_str` after making exactly one flip operation on some substring.\\\\n\\\\n#### Constraints\\\\n- The input string consists only of \\'0\\'s and \\'1\\'s.\\\\n- The string has a minimum length of 1 character, with no more than \\\\\\\\(2 \\\\times 10^5\\\\\\\\) characters.\\\\n\\\\n#### Example\\\\nassert minimize_binary_string(\\\\\"101\\\\\") == \\\\\"011\\\\\"\\\\nassert minimize_binary_string(\\\\\"001\\\\\") == \\\\\"000\\\\\"\", \"code\": \"from typing import *\\\\n\\\\n\\\\ndef minimize_binary_string(binary_str: str) -> str:\\\\n    flip_count = binary_str.count(\\'0\\')\\\\n    min_index = None\\\\n    min_flip_point = float(\\\\\\\\\\'inf\\\\\\\\\\')\\\\n    for i, char in enumerate(binary_str):\\\\n        if char == \\'1\\':\\\\n            flip_count -= 1\\\\n            if flip_count < min_flip_point:\\\\n                min_flip_point = flip_count\\\\n                min_index = i\\\\n    return binary_str[:min_index] + (\\'0\\' if binary_str[min_index] == \\'1\\' else \\'1\\') + binary_str[min_index+1:]\", \"tests\": [\"assert minimize_binary_string(\\\\\"101\\\\\") == \\\\\"011\\\\\"\", \"assert minimize_binary_string(\\\\\"001\\\\\") == \\\\\"000\\\\\"\", \"assert minimize_binary_string(\\\\\"111\\\\\") == \\\\\"011\\\\\"\", \"assert minimize_binary_string(\\\\\"000\\\\\") == \\\\\"000\\\\\"\"]}'}"
