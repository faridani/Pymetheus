Default is 0.\\\\\\\\n- `end` (int, optional): The index of the ending position for comparison. If not provided, it defaults to the length of the string minus the index of the start position.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n#### Output\\\\\\\\n- Returns `True` if the substring from the starting index to the ending index is a palindrome, `False` otherwise.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nHint: You may find it useful to use the built-in function `s[start:end]` to get a substring of the original string.\\\\\", \\\\\"code\\\\\": \\\\\"import string\\\\\\\\ndef is_palindrome(s: str, start: int = 0, end: int = None) -> bool:\\\\\\\\n    if not end:\\\\\\\\n        end = len(s) - 1\\\\\\\\n    # Base case: If the starting index and ending index are equal, return True\\\\\\\\n    if start == end:\\\\\\\\n        return True\\\\\\\\n    # Recursive case: Compare characters at the starting index and the ending index.
