"{'model': 'gemma2:27b', 'response': '\"{ \\\\\"title\\\\\": \\\\\"Medium - Array Rotation\\\\\", \\\\\"description\\\\\": \\\\\"You are given an array of integers `arr` and a positive integer `k`. You need to rotate the array `arr` by `k` positions to the right. For example, if `arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]` and `k = 2`, the rotated array should be `[4, 5, 1, 2, 3]`. Write a function `rotate_array(arr, k)` that performs this rotation.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n#### Function Signature\\\\\\\\n```python\\\\\\\\ndef rotate_array(arr: list[int], k: int) -> list[int]:\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n#### Input\\\\\\\\n- `arr` (list[int]): A list of integers.\\\\\\\\n- `k` (int): The number of positions to rotate the array to the right.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n#### Output\\\\\\\\n- Returns a new list representing the rotated array.\\\\\", \\\\\"code\\\\\": \\\\\"def rotate_array(arr: list[int], k: int) -> list[int]:\\\\\\\\n    n = len(arr)\\\\\\\\n    k %= n\\\\\\\\n    return arr[-k:] + arr[:-k]\\\\\", \\\\\"tests\\\\\": [\\\\\"assert rotate_array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5], 2) == [4, 5, 1, 2, 3]\\\\\", \\\\\"assert rotate_array([1, 2, 3], 4) == [3, 1, 2]\\\\\", \\\\\"assert rotate_array([-1, -100, 3, 99], 2) == [3, 99, -1, -100]\\\\\"] }\"'}"
