"{'model': 'gemma2:27b', 'response': '\"{ \\\\\"title\\\\\": \\\\\"Hard: Alien Alphabet\\\\\", \\\\\"description\\\\\": \\\\\"The aliens have landed, and they\\'ve brought their language with them! They use an alphabet of 26 unique symbols to represent letters, but the order of these symbols is completely different from our own.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nYou\\'ve managed to intercept a message from the alien leader.  Unfortunately, it\\'s just a jumbled string of symbols. To decode it, you need to figure out the correct ordering of the alien alphabet. \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nLuckily, the aliens have provided a dictionary containing words in their language, along with their English translations. Your task is to use this dictionary to determine the order of the alien alphabet.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n#### Function Signature\\\\\\\\n```python\\\\\\\\ndef alien_alphabet(words: list[str], translations: dict) -> str:\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n#### Input\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n- `words`: A list of strings representing words in the alien language.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n- `translations`: A dictionary where keys are alien words (strings) and values are their English translations (also strings).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n#### Output\\\\\\\\n- Returns a string representing the order of the alien alphabet, from first letter to last.  For example, if the alien alphabet is \\'zyxwvutsrqponmlkjihgfedcba\\', the function should return \\'zyxwvutsrqponmlkjihgfedcba\\'. If it\\'s not possible to determine a unique ordering, return an empty string \\'\\'.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n#### Constraints\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n- The number of words in `words` will be between 1 and 100.\\\\\\\\n- Each alien word will be composed of lowercase letters only.\\\\\\\\n- The length of each alien word will be between 1 and 20 characters.\\\\\\\\n- The dictionary `translations` will contain at least one key-value pair.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n#### Hints\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThink about how you can compare pairs of words to deduce the relative order of their letters. Consider edge cases where a unique ordering might not be possible.\\\\\", \\\\\"code\\\\\": \\\\\"def alien_alphabet(words: list[str], translations: dict) -> str:\\\\\\\\n    adj_list = {}\\\\\\\\n    for word1, translation1 in translations.items():\\\\\\\\n        for word2, translation2 in translations.items():\\\\\\\\n            if translation1 < translation2 and word1 != word2:\\\\\\\\n                for i in range(min(len(word1), len(word2))):\\\\\\\\n                    if word1[i] != word2[i]:\\\\\\\\n                        if word1[i] not in adj_list:\\\\\\\\n                            adj_list[word1[i]] = set()\\\\\\\\n                        adj_list[word1[i]].add(word2[i])\\\\\\\\n                        break\\\\\\\\n    result = []\\\\\\\\n    visited = set()\\\\\\\\n    for node in adj_list:\\\\\\\\n        if node not in visited:\\\\\\\\n            dfs(node, adj_list, result, visited)\\\\\\\\n    return \\'\\'.join(result)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\ndef dfs(node: str, adj_list: dict, result: list, visited: set) -> None:\\\\\\\\n    visited.add(node)\\\\\\\\n    for neighbor in adj_list.get(node, []):\\\\\\\\n        if neighbor not in visited:\\\\\\\\n            dfs(neighbor, adj_list, result, visited)\\\\\\\\n    result.append(node)\\\\\", \\\\\"tests\\\\\": [\\\\\"words = [\\'hgt\\', \\'fgh\\']\\\\\\\\ntranslations = {\\'hgt\\': \\'cat\\', \\'fgh\\': \\'dog\\'}\\\\\\\\ assert alien_alphabet(words, translations) == \\'hgft\\'\\\\\", \\\\\"words=[\\'zlb\\',\\'zl\\',\\'zyv\\']\\\\\\\\ntranslations={\\'zlb\\':\\'apple\\',\\'zl\\':\\'banana\\',\\'zyv\\':\\'cherry\\'} \\\\\\\\nassert alien_alphabet(words,translations) == \\'lbyzv\\'\\\\\", \\\\\"words=[\\'abc\\', \\'abd\\']\\\\\\\\ntranslations={\\'abc\\': \\'hello\\', \\'abd\\': \\'world\\'}\\\\\\\\nassert alien_alphabet(words, translations) == \\'abdc\\'\\\\\"] }\"'}"
