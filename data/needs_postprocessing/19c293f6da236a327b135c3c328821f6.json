Your task is to decipher this code and translate it into English.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe alien alphabet consists of only 5 characters: \\'A\\', \\'B\\', \\'C\\', \\'D\\', and \\'E\\'.  Each character in the alien language corresponds to a sequence of three letters in English.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nHere\\'s the mapping:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* \\'A\\': \\'the\\'\\\\\\\\n* \\'B\\': \\'quick\\'\\\\\\\\n* \\'C\\': \\'brown\\'\\\\\\\\n* \\'D\\': \\'fox\\'\\\\\\\\n* \\'E\\': \\'jumps\\'\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe aliens write their words by concatenating these three-letter sequences. For example, the alien word \\'CAB\\' would translate to \\'the quick brown\\'.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n#### Function Signature\\\\\\\\n```python\\\\\\\\ndef translate_alien_message(message: str) -> str:\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n#### Input\\\\\\\\n- `message` (str): A string containing the alien message.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n#### Output\\\\\\\\n- Returns a string with the translated English message.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\", \\\\\"code\\\\\": \\\\\"def translate_alien_message(message: str) -> str:\\\\\\\\n    mapping = {\\'A\\': \\'the\\', \\'B\\': \\'quick\\', \\'C\\': \\'brown\\', \\'D\\': \\'fox\\', \\'E\\': \\'jumps\\'}\\\\\\\\n    translated_message = \\'\\'\\\\\\\\n    for char in message:\\\\\\\\n        translated_message += mapping[char] + \\' \\'\\\\\\\\n    return translated_message.strip() \\\\\", \\\\\"tests\\\\\": [\\\\\"assert translate_alien_message(\\\\\\\\\\\\\"CAB\\\\\\\\\\\\\") == \\\\\\\\\\\\\"the quick brown \\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\", \\\\\"assert translate_alien_message(\\\\\\\\\\\\\"DEBA\\\\\\\\\\\\\") == \\\\\\\\\\\\\"fox jumps the quick\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\", \\\\\"assert translate_alien_message(\\\\\\\\\\\\\"EACBAD\\\\\\\\\\\\\") == \\\\\\\\\\\\\"the quick brown fox jumps the quick\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\", \\\\\"assert translate_alien_message(\\\\\\\\\\\\\"AAA\\\\\\\\\\\\\") == \\\\\\\\\\\\\"the the the \\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\"] }\"'}"
