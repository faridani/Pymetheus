The forest has N nodes, numbered from 0 to N-1. Each node i has two children: left child L(i) and right child R(i). The children can be either null or they can point to another node in the forest.\\\\n\\\\nA path in the forest is a sequence of nodes such that each node in the sequence is the parent of the next one, except for the last node. A fruit tree is a node with exactly one non-null child (i.e., it's an Apple or Banana tree).\\\\n\\\\nYour task is to write a function `fruit_tree_count` that takes the root of the forest and returns the total count of Apple and Banana trees.\\\\n\\\\n#### Function Signature\\\\n```python\\\\ndef fruit_tree_count(root: int) -> int:\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\n#### Input\\\\n- `root` (int): The root node of the forest.\\\\n\\\\n#### Output\\\\n- Returns an integer representing the total count of Apple and Banana trees in the forest.\\\\n\\\", \\\"code\\\": \\\"\\\\nimport collections\\\\n\\\\ndef fruit_tree_count(root: int) -> int:\\\\n    tree_counts = [0, 0]\\\\n    def dfs(node):\\\\n        if not node:\\\\n            return\\\\n        if node == 1:\\\\n            tree_counts[0] += 1\\\\n        elif node == 2:\\\\n            tree_counts[1] += 1\\\\n        else:\\\\n            dfs(node - 3)\\\\n            dfs(node // 2)\\\\n\\\\n    dfs(root)\\\\n    return sum(tree_counts)\\\", \\\"tests\\\": [\\\"assert fruit_tree_count(1) == 1\\\", \\\"assert fruit_tree_count(2) == 1\\\", \\\"assert fruit_tree_count(4) == 0\\\", \\\"assert fruit_tree_count(5) == 1\\\"] }\""
