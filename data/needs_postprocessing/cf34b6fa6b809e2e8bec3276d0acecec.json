Each node has an associated positive integer value called its weight. You need to find the path from a source node `s` to a target node `t` that maximizes the sum of the weights of all nodes in the path, including both the start and end nodes. If multiple paths yield the same maximum sum, choose the one with the fewest number of edges; if there's still a tie, choose the lexicographically smallest path.\\\\n\\\\n#### Function Signature\\\\n```python\\\\ndef find_hardest_path(n: int, m: int, node_weights: List[int], edges: List[Tuple[int, int, int]], s: int, t: int) -> Tuple[int, List[int]]:\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\n#### Input\\\\n- `n` (int): The number of nodes in the graph.\\\\n- `m` (int): The number of directed edges in the graph.\\\\n- `node_weights` (List[int]): A list of integers where the i-th integer is the weight of node `i+1`.\\\\n- `edges` (List[Tuple[int, int, int]]): A list of tuples `(u, v, w)` representing a directed edge from node `u` to node `v` with weight `w`. Nodes are 1-indexed.\\\\n- `s` (int): The source node.\\\\n- `t` (int): The target node.\\\\n\\\\n#### Output\\\\n- Returns a tuple containing the maximum sum of weights on the path and the path itself as a list of nodes. If no path exists, return (-1, []).\\\\n\\\\n#### Constraints\\\\n- 2 \\u2264 n \\u2264 1000\\\\n- 1 \\u2264 m \\u2264 5000\\\\n- 1 \\u2264 node_weights[i] \\u2264 10^6 for all valid i\\\\n- 1 \\u2264 u, v \\u2264 n and 1 \\u2264 w \\u2264 10^6 for each edge (u, v, w)\\\\n- The graph may contain cycles.\\\\n\\\\n#### Hints\\\\n- Consider using a modified Dijkstra's algorithm to keep track of node weights in the path and handle tie-breaking conditions.\\\", \\\"code\\\": \\\"from typing import List, Tuple\\\\nimport heapq\\\\n\\\\ndef find_hardest_path(n: int, m: int, node_weights: List[int], edges: List[Tuple[int, int, int]], s: int, t: int) -> Tuple[int, List[int]]:\\\\n    # Convert 1-indexed to 0-indexed for internal processing\\\\n    adj = [[] for _ in range(n)]\\\\n    for u, v, w in edges:\\\\n        adj[u-1].append((v-1, w))\\\\n    \\\\n    # Priority queue will store (-weight_sum, num_edges, node_index, path)\\\\n    pq = [(-node_weights[s-1], 0, s-1, [s])]\\\\n    max_weight = [-float('inf')] * n\\\\n    min_edges = [float('inf')] * n\\\\n    best_path = [[] for _ in range(n)]\\\\n    \\\\n    while pq:\\\\n        neg_weight_sum, num_edges, node, path = heapq.heappop(pq)\\\\n        if node == t-1:\\\\n            return (-neg_weight_sum, path)\\\\n        if -neg_weight_sum < max_weight[node]:\\\\n            continue\\\\n        for neighbor, _ in adj[node]:\\\\n            new_weight_sum = neg_weight_sum - node_weights[neighbor]\\\\n            new_num_edges = num_edges + 1\\\\n            new_path = path + [neighbor+1]\\\\n            if (new_weight_sum > max_weight[neighbor] or \\\\\\\\\\\\n                (new_weight_sum == max_weight[neighbor] and new_num_edges < min_edges[neighbor]) or \\\\\\\\\\\\n                (new_weight_sum == max_weight[neighbor] and new_num_edges == min_edges[neighbor] and new_path < best_path[neighbor])):\\\\n                    max_weight[neighbor] = new_weight_sum\\\\n                    min_edges[neighbor] = new_num_edges\\\\n                    heapq.heappush(pq, (new_weight_sum, new_num_edges, neighbor, new_path))\\\\n                    best_path[neighbor] = new_path\\\\n    return (-1, [])\\\\n\\\", \\\"tests\\\": [\\\"assert find_hardest_path(4, 5, [1, 2, 3, 4], [(1, 2, 1), (2, 3, 1), (3, 4, 1), (1, 3, 2), (2, 4, 2)], 1, 4) == (10, [1, 3, 4])\\\", \\\"assert find_hardest_path(3, 3, [5, 6, 7], [(1, 2, 1), (2, 3, 1), (1, 3, 2)], 1, 3) == (18, [1, 2, 3])\\\", \\\"assert find_hardest_path(4, 4, [10, 20, 30, 40], [(1, 2, 5), (2, 3, 5), (3, 4, 5), (1, 4, 50)], 1, 4) == (100, [1, 4])\\\", \\\"assert find_hardest_path(3, 2, [10, 20, 30], [(1, 2, 10), (2, 3, 20)], 1, 3) == (60, [1, 2, 3])\\\", \\\"assert find_hardest_path(5, 6, [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], [(1, 2, 10), (2, 3, 10), (3, 4, 10), (4, 5, 10), (1, 3, 20), (3, 5, 30)], 1, 5) == (15, [1, 3, 5])\\\"] }\""
