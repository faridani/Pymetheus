However, unlike traditional palindromes, ignore the case of alphabetic characters, spaces, and consider punctuation as invisible. For example: \\\\\\\\\\\\\"A man, a plan, a canal, Panama\\\\\\\\\\\\\" is a palindrome even though it has spaces and punctuation.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n#### Function Signature\\\\\\\\n```python\\\\\\\\ndef is_palindrome(s: str) -> bool:\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n#### Input\\\\\\\\n- `s` (str): A string that may contain letters, numbers, spaces, and punctuation marks.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n#### Output\\\\\\\\n- Returns `True` if the input string is a palindrome (ignoring case, spaces, and punctuation), `False` otherwise.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\", \\\\\"code\\\\\": \\\\\"import re, string\\\\\\\\ndef is_palindrome(s: str) -> bool:\\\\\\\\n    # Remove non-alphanumeric characters and convert to lowercase\\\\\\\\n    s = re.sub(\\'[^a-zA-Z0-9]\\', \\'\\', s).lower()\\\\\\\\n    # Check if the string reads the same forwards and backwards, ignoring case\\\\\\\\n    return s == s[::-1]\\\\\\\\n\\\\\", \\\\\"tests\\\\\": [\\\\\"assert is_palindrome(\\\\\\\\\\\\\"A man, a plan, a canal, Panama\\\\\\\\\\\\\") == True\\\\\", \\\\\"assert is_palindrome(\\\\\\\\\\\\\"racecar\\\\\\\\\\\\\") == True\\\\\", \\\\\"assert is_palindrome(\\\\\\\\\\\\\"hello\\\\\\\\\\\\\") == False\\\\\", \\\\\"assert is_palindrome(\\\\\\\\\\\\\"No \\\\u2019x\\\\u2019 in Nixon\\\\\\\\\\\\\") == True\\\\\"] }\"'}"
