It\\'s defined as follows:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nF(0) = 0 \\\\\\\\n F(1) = 1\\\\\\\\n F(n) = F(n - 1) + F(n - 2) for n > 1.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n  A curious property of the Fibonacci sequence is that it exhibits cyclicity when considering the last digit of each number. For example, in base 10:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nFibonacci sequence (last digits): 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 3, 1, 4, ... \\\\\\\\n Notice that the sequence  {0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8} repeats.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n Write a function `fibonacci_cycle(base)` that takes an integer `base` as input and returns:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* The length of the cycle of the Fibonacci sequence when considering its last digits in the given `base`. \\\\\\\\n For example: `fibonacci_cycle(10)` should return 60.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\", \\\\\"code\\\\\": \\\\\"def fibonacci_cycle(base):\\\\\\\\n    fib_numbers = [0, 1]\\\\\\\\n    seen_digits = {}\\\\\\\\n    cycle_length = 0\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    while True:\\\\\\\\n        next_fib = (fib_numbers[-1] + fib_numbers[-2]) % base\\\\\\\\n        fib_numbers.append(next_fib)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n        if next_fib in seen_digits:\\\\\\\\n            cycle_length = len(fib_numbers) - seen_digits[next_fib]\\\\\\\\n            break\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n        seen_digits[next_fib] = len(fib_numbers)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    return cycle_length\\\\\\\\n\\\\\", \\\\\"tests\\\\\": [\\\\\"assert fibonacci_cycle(10) == 60\\\\\", \\\\\"assert fibonacci_cycle(2) == 3\\\\\", \\\\\"assert fibonacci_cycle(5) == 20\\\\\"] }\"'}"
