Write a function `is_anagram` that checks if two given strings are anagrams of each other.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n#### Function Signature\\\\\\\\n```python\\\\\\\\ndef is_anagram(s1: str, s2: str) -> bool:\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n#### Input\\\\\\\\n- `s1`, `s2` (str): Two strings that may contain letters and spaces.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n#### Output\\\\\\\\n- Returns `True` if the input strings are anagrams of each other, `False` otherwise.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n#### Constraints\\\\\\\\n- The input strings may contain only lowercase letters and spaces. Spaces are considered as a single character. For example, \\'hello world\\' is treated as \\'helloworld\\'.\\\\\", \\\\\"code\\\\\": \\\\\"def is_anagram(s1: str, s2: str) -> bool:\\\\\\\\n    # Remove spaces from the strings\\\\\\\\n    s1 = sorted(\\'\\'.join(s1.split()).lower())\\\\\\\\n    s2 = sorted(\\'\\'.join(s2.split()).lower())\\\\\\\\n    # Check if both lists are equal\\\\\\\\n    return len(s1) == len(s2) and s1 == s2\\\\\", \\\\\"tests\\\\\": [\\\\\"assert is_anagram(\\'listen\\', \\'silent\\') == True\\\\\", \\\\\"assert is_anagram(\\'hello world\\', \\'world hello\\') == True\\\\\", \\\\\"assert is_anagram(\\'apple\\', \\'appel\\') == False\\\\\"] }\"'}"
