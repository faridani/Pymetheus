It consists of three rods, and a number of disks of different sizes that can slide onto any rod.\\\\nThe objective of the puzzle is to move the entire stack to another rod, obeying the following rules:\\\\n1. Only one disk can be moved at a time.\\\\n2. Each move involves taking the upper disk from one of the stacks and placing it on top of another stack or on a free rod.\\\\n3. No disk may be placed on top of a smaller disk.\\\\n\\\\nYou are given three rods, source, auxiliary and target. You have n disks of size 1 to n that you need to move from the source rod to the target rod using the auxiliary rod as an intermediate storage.
