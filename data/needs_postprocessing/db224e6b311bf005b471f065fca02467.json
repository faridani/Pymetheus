These islands have been inhabited for centuries, but the inhabitants of each island speak different languages. The inhabitants of Isla_1 use a binary language, while those of Isla_2 use a ternary language (using digits 0, 1, and 2).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nEvery year, the inhabitants organize a unique contest to prove their mathematical prowess: they exchange a series of numbers from their respective languages, aiming to find a number that is equal in both languages. Write a function `binary_ternary_equality` that takes two numbers (one in binary and one in ternary) as input and returns `True` if they are equal when represented in either base, `False` otherwise.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n#### Function Signature\\\\\\\\n```python\\\\\\\\ndef binary_ternary_equality(b: int, t: int) -> bool:\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n#### Input\\\\\\\\n- `b` (int): A non-negative integer representing a number in the binary system.\\\\\\\\n- `t` (int): A non-negative integer representing a number in the ternary system.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n#### Output\\\\\\\\n- Returns `True` if the input numbers are equal when represented in either base, `False` otherwise.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\", \\\\\"code\\\\\": \\\\\"def binary_ternary_equality(b: int, t: int) -> bool:\\\\\\\\n    # Convert binary to decimal\\\\\\\\n    b_decimal = bin(b)[2:] if b >= 0 else \\'0\\' + bin(b)[2:]\\\\\\\\n    # Convert ternary to decimal\\\\\\\\n    t_decimal = tarian_to_decimal(t)\\\\\\\\n    \\\\\\\\n    return int(b_decimal) == t_decimal\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\ndef tarian_to_decimal(t: int) -> int:\\\\\\\\n    total = 0\\\\\\\\n    exponent = 0\\\\\\\\n    while t > 0:\\\\\\\\n        remainder = t % 3\\\\\\\\n        total += remainder * (3 ** exponent)\\\\\\\\n        t //= 3\\\\\\\\n        exponent += 1\\\\\\\\n    return total\\\\\", \\\\\"tests\\\\\": [\\\\\"assert binary_ternary_equality(7, 5) == True\\\\\", \\\\\"assert binary_ternary_equality(9, 6) == False\\\\\", \\\\\"assert binary_ternary_equality(10, 2) == True\\\\\", \\\\\"assert binary_ternary_equality(20, 10) == True\\\\\", \\\\\"assert binary_ternary_equality(-3, -11) == False\\\\\"] }\"'}"
