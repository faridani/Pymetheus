The function should return the list of these palindromes, sorted in increasing order of their start index.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n#### Function Signature\\\\\\\\n```python\\\\\\\\ndef find_palindromes(s: str) -> List[List[int]]:\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n#### Input\\\\\\\\n- `s` (str): A string that may contain letters, numbers, spaces, and punctuation.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n#### Output\\\\\\\\n- Returns a list of lists. Each inner list contains two integers representing the start index and end index (exclusive) of a palindrome in the input string.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nFor example, for the input `A man, a plan, a canal: Panama`, the function should return:\\\\\\\\n```python\\\\\\\\n[   [0, 1],\\\\\\\\n   [2, 3],\\\\\\\\n   [4, 5],\\\\\\\\n   [6, 7],\\\\\\\\n   [8, 9],\\\\\\\\n   [12, 13],\\\\\\\\n   [14, 15]  ]\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\", \\\\\"code\\\\\": \\\\\"import collections\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\ndef find_palindromes(s: str) -> List[List[int]]:\\\\\\\\n    # Create a dictionary to store counts of odd-length palindrome centers\\\\\\\\n    count = collections.defaultdict(int)\\\\\\\\n    for i in range(len(s)):\\\\\\\\n        for j in range(i, len(s)):\\\\\\\\n            substring = s[i:j + 1]\\\\\\\\n            if len(substring) > 1 and substring == substring[::-1]:\\\\\\\\n                count[i] += 1\\\\\\\\n    # Initialize an empty list to store palindromes\\\\\\\\n    palindromes = []\\\\\\\\n    # Iterate through the string, starting from each character as a potential center of a palindrome\\\\\\\\n    for i in range(len(s)):\\\\\\\\n        if count[i] == 0:\\\\\\\\n            continue\\\\\\\\n        if count[i + 1] == 0 and (i + 2 > len(s) or count[i + 2] == 0):\\\\\\\\n            # If the center character has an odd count, this means it\\'s the center of a palindrome with an odd number of characters.\\\\\\\\n            # Check if the next two characters form a possible extension of the palindrome.\\\\\\\\n            for j in range(i + 1, i - 1, -2):\\\\\\\\n                substring = s[j:i][::-1] == s[i:j][::-1]\\\\\\\\n                if substring:\\\\\\\\n                    # If the extension is a palindrome, add it to the list.\\\\\\\\n                    palindromes.append([j - len(substring), i])\\\\\\\\n        elif count[i + 1] > 0 and (i + 3 > len(s) or count[i + 3] == 0):\\\\\\\\n            # If the center character has an even count, this means it\\'s the middle of a palindrome with an odd number of characters.\\\\\\\\n            # Check if the next three characters form a possible extension of the palindrome.\\\\\\\\n            for j in range(i + 1, i - 3, -2):\\\\\\\\n                substring = s[j:i][::-1] == s[i:j][::-1]\\\\\\\\n                if substring:\\\\\\\\n                    # If the extension is a palindrome, add it to the list.\\\\\\\\n                    palindromes.append([j - len(substring), i])\\\\\\\\n    # Sort the palindromes by their start index\\\\\\\\n    palindromes.sort()\\\\\\\\n    return palindromes\\\\\", \\\\\"tests\\\\\": [\\\\\"assert find_palindromes(\\'A man, a plan, a canal: Panama\\') == [   [0, 1],\\\\\\\\n    [2, 3],\\\\\\\\n    [4, 5],\\\\\\\\n    [6, 7],\\\\\\\\n    [8, 9],\\\\\\\\n    [12, 13],\\\\\\\\n    [14, 15]  ]\\\\\", \\\\\"assert find_palindromes(\\'racecar\\') == [   [0, 0],\\\\\\\\n    [1, 3],\\\\\\\\n    [2, 4],\\\\\\\\n    [3, 5]\\\\\\\\n  ]\\\\\", \\\\\"assert find_palindromes(\\'hello\\') == []\\\\\", \\\\\"assert find_palindromes(\\'No \\\\\\\\\\'x\\\\\\\\\\' in Nixon\\') == [   [0, 1],\\\\\\\\n    [2, 4],\\\\\\\\n    [5, 7]\\\\\\\\n  ]\\\\\"] }\"'}"
