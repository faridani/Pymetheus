Their alphabet consists of unique symbols represented by numbers 0-9 and A-Z (total of 36 symbols).  They use a simple substitution cipher where each symbol in their language maps to a corresponding letter in the English alphabet.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nYou were able to decipher a few words from previous transmissions, giving you the following mapping:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* 5 = \\'e\\'\\\\\\\\n* D = \\'t\\'\\\\\\\\n* 1A = \\'h\\'\\\\\\\\n* B = \\'a\\'\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWrite a function `decode_alien_message` that takes the ciphered message as input and returns the decoded English message.
