That is, for any two elements at positions i and j in the subarray, |i - j| must be greater than k. If no valid subarray exists, return 0.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nExample:\\\\\\\\nInput: nums = [3, -2, 5, -1], k = 2\\\\\\\\nOutput: 6\\\\\\\\nExplanation: The subarray [3, 5] sums to 8 but elements are at positions 0 and 2 (distance 2), which is not greater than k=2. So the valid subarrays would be single elements or non-consecutive elements with distance >k. Hence, the maximum sum is 6 from either 3 or 5.\\\\\", \\\\\"code\\\\\": { \\\\\"python\\\\\": \\\\\"def max_sum_subarray(nums, k):\\\\\\\\n    if not nums:\\\\\\\\n        return 0\\\\\\\\n    n = len(nums)\\\\\\\\n    dp = [0] * (n + 1)\\\\\\\\n    for i in range(1, n+1):\\\\\\\\n        max_prev = -float(\\'inf\\')\\\\\\\\n        # Look back up to k steps\\\\\\\\n        start = max(0, i - k -1)\\\\\\\\n        for j in range(start, i):\\\\\\\\n            if dp[j] > max_prev:\\\\\\\\n                max_prev = dp[j]\\\\\\\\n        dp[i] = max(nums[i-1], nums[i-1] + (max_prev if max_prev != -float(\\'inf\\') else 0))\\\\\\\\n    return max(dp)\\\\\" } }\"'}"
