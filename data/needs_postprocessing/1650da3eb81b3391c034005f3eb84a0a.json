The function should return a list of numbers representing the Fibonacci sequence. For this problem, consider the first two numbers in the sequence as 0 and 1.\\\\n\\\\n#### Function Signature\\\\n```python\\\\ndef generate_fibonacci(n: int) -> List[int]:\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\n#### Input\\\\n- `n` (int): A positive integer that specifies up to which number in the Fibonacci sequence should be generated.\\\\n\\\\n#### Output\\\\n- Returns a list of integers representing the Fibonacci sequence up to and including the nth Fibonacci number. If `n` is less than or equal to 0, return an empty list.\\\\n\\\\nHints:\\\\n1. Start with two initial numbers: 0 and 1.\\\\n2. Use a loop to generate the next numbers in the sequence by summing up the last two numbers.\\\\n3.
