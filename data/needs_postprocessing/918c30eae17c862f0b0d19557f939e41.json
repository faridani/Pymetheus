"{'model': 'mistral:latest', 'response': '\"{ \\\\\"title\\\\\": \\\\\"\\'Anagram Detector (Hard)\\'\\\\\", \\\\\"description\\\\\": \\\\\"An anagram is a word or phrase formed by rearranging the letters of a different word or phrase, typically using all the original letters exactly once. Write a function `is_anagram` that checks if two given strings are anagrams.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n#### Function Signature\\\\\\\\n```python\\\\\\\\ndef is_anagram(str1: str, str2: str) -> bool:\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n#### Input\\\\\\\\n- `str1` (str): A non-empty string containing only lowercase letters and spaces.\\\\\\\\n- `str2` (str): A non-empty string containing only lowercase letters and spaces.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n#### Output\\\\\\\\n- Returns `True` if the two input strings are anagrams, `False` otherwise.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n#### Constraints\\\\\\\\n- Both strings may contain spaces. The spaces in the strings should be considered when comparing the anagram.\\\\\\\\n- No two strings will have the same number of characters, ensuring that the function can simply compare the characters in each string and not worry about reordering them.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\", \\\\\"code\\\\\": \\\\\"def is_anagram(str1: str, str2: str) -> bool:\\\\\\\\n    # Remove spaces from both strings\\\\\\\\n    str1 = \\'\\'.join([char for char in str1 if char != \\' \\'])\\\\\\\\n    str2 = \\'\\'.join([char for char in str2 if char != \\' \\'])\\\\\\\\n    \\\\\\\\n    # If the two strings have different lengths, they are not anagrams\\\\\\\\n    if len(str1) != len(str2):\\\\\\\\n        return False\\\\\\\\n    \\\\\\\\n    # Create a dictionary to count the frequency of each character in str1\\\\\\\\n    char_count = {char: str1.count(char) for char in string.ascii_lowercase}\\\\\\\\n    \\\\\\\\n    # Decrease the count of each character in str2 that appears in the current anagram and check if any counts go below 0.\\\\\\\\n    for char in str2:\\\\\\\\n        if char not in char_count or char_count[char] <= 0:\\\\\\\\n            return False\\\\\\\\n        char_count[char] -= 1\\\\\\\\n    \\\\\\\\n    # If we have gone through all characters in str2 and no counts went below 0, the strings are anagrams\\\\\\\\n    return True\\\\\", \\\\\"tests\\\\\": [\\\\\"assert is_anagram(\\\\\\\\\\\\\"listen\\\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\\\"silent\\\\\\\\\\\\\") == True\\\\\", \\\\\"assert is_anagram(\\\\\\\\\\\\\"hello world\\\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\\\"world hello\\\\\\\\\\\\\") == True\\\\\", \\\\\"assert is_anagram(\\\\\\\\\\\\\"example\\\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\\\"maximum\\\\\\\\\\\\\") == True\\\\\", \\\\\"assert is_anagram(\\\\\\\\\\\\\"apple\\\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\\\"apples\\\\\\\\\\\\\") == False\\\\\", \\\\\"assert is_anagram(\\\\\\\\\\\\\"racecar\\\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\\\"carerace\\\\\\\\\\\\\") == True\\\\\"] }\"'}"
