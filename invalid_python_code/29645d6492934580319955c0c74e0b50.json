    "description": "Write a function that counts the number of islands in an n x n grid of water and land. The function should take an n x n integer matrix as input, where each element represents the type of cell (0 for water, 1 for land). Return the number of islands as a single integer. Constraints: n is a positive integer, 1 <= n <= 50. Hints: Think about how you can use a queue to keep track of the islands. Consider using a modulo operator to keep track of the number of islands.",
